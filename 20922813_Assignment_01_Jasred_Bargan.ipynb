me if it be ought toward the generall good set honor in one eye and death ith other and i will looke on both indifferently for let the gods so speed mee as i loue the name of honor more then i feare death cassi . i know that vertue to be in you brutus as well as i do know your outward fauour . well honor is the subiect of my story i cannot tell what you and other men thinke of this life but for my single selfe i had as liefe not be as liue to be in awe of such a thing as i my selfe . i was borne free as caesar so were you we both haue fed as well and we can both endure the winters cold as well as hee . for once vpon a rawe and gustie day the troubled tyber chafing with her shores caesar saide to me darst thou cassius now leape in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point vpon the word accoutred as i was i plunged in and bad him follow so indeed he did . the torrent roard and we did buffet it with lusty sinewes throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controuersie . but ere we could arriue the point proposd caesar cride helpe me cassius or i sinke . i as aeneas our great ancestor did from the flames of troy vpon his shoulder the old anchyses beare so from the waues of tyber did i the tyred caesar and this man is now become a god and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelesly but nod on him . he had a feauer when he was in spaine and when the fit was on him i did marke how he did shake tis true this god did shake his coward lippes did from their colour flye and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did loose his lustre i did heare him grone i and that tongue of his that bad the romans marke him and write his speeches in their bookes alas it cried giue me some drinke titinius as a sicke girle ye gods it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the maiesticke world and beare the palme alone . shout . flourish . bru . another generall shout i do beleeue that these applauses are for some new honors that are heapd on caesar cassi . why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walke vnder his huge legges and peepe about to finde our selues dishonourable graues . men at sometime are masters of their fates . the fault deere brutus is not in our starres but in our selues that we are vnderlings . brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar why should that name be sounded more then yours write them together yours is as faire a name sound them it doth become the mouth aswell weigh them it is as heauy coniure with em brutus will start a spirit as soone as caesar . now in the names of all the gods at once vpon what meate doth this our caesar feede that he is growne so great age thou art shamd . rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods . when went there by an age since the great flood but it was famd with more then with one man when could they say till now that talkd of rome that her wide walkes incompast but one man now is it rome indeed and roome enough when there is in it but one onely man . o you and i haue heard our fathers say there was a brutus once that would haue brookd th eternall diuell to keepe his state in rome as easily as a king bru . that you do loue me i am nothing iealous what you would worke me too i haue some ayme how i haue thought of this and of these times i shall recount heereafter . for this present i would not so with loue i might intreat you be any further mooud what you haue said i will consider what you haue to say i will with patience heare and finde a time both meete to heare and answer such high things . till then my noble friend chew vpon this brutus had rather be a villager then to repute himselfe a sonne of rome vnder these hard conditions as this time is like to lay vpon vs cassi . i am glad that my weake words haue strucke but thus much shew of fire from brutus enter caesar and his traine . bru . the games are done and caesar is returning cassi . as they passe by plucke caska by the sleeue and he will after his sowre fashion tell you what hath proceeded worthy note to day bru . i will do so but looke you cassius the angry spot doth glow on caesars brow and all the rest looke like a chidden traine calphurnias cheeke is pale and cicero lookes with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we haue seene him in the capitoll being crost in conference by some senators cassi . caska will tell vs what the matter is caes antonio ant . caesar caes let me haue men about me that are fat sleekeheaded men and such as sleepe anights yond cassius has a leane and hungry looke he thinkes too much such men are dangerous ant . feare him not caesar hes not dangerous he is a noble roman and well giuen caes would he were fatter but i feare him not yet if my name were lyable to feare i do not know the man i should auoyd so soone as that spare cassius . he reades much he is a great obseruer and he lookes quite through the deeds of men . he loues no playes as thou dost antony he heares no musicke seldome he smiles and smiles in such a sort as if he mockd himselfe and scornd his spirit that could be moud to smile at any thing . such men as he be neuer at hearts ease whiles they behold a greater then themselues and therefore are they very dangerous . i rather tell thee what is to be feard then what i feare for alwayes i am caesar . come on my right hand for this eare is deafe and tell me truely what thou thinkst of him . sennit . exeunt . caesar and his traine . cask . you puld me by the cloake would you speake with me bru . i caska tell vs what hath chancd to day that caesar lookes so sad cask . why you were with him were you not bru . i should not then aske caska what had chancd cask . why there was a crowne offerd him  being offerd him he put it by with the backe of his hand thus and then the people fell a shouting bru . what was the second noyse for cask . why for that too cassi . they shouted thrice what was the last cry for cask . why for that too bru . was the crowne offerd him thrice cask . i marry wast and hee put it by thrice euerie time gentler then other and at euery putting by mine honest neighbors showted cassi . who offerd him the crowne cask . why antony bru . tell vs the manner of it gentle caska caska . i can as well bee hangd as tell the manner of it it was meere foolerie i did not marke it . i sawe marke antony offer him a crowne yet twas not a crowne neyther twas one of these coronets and as i told you hee put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would faine haue had it . then hee offered it to him againe then hee put it by againe but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it . and then he offered it the third time hee put it the third time by and still as hee refusd it the rabblement howted and clappd their chopt hands and threw vppe their sweatie nightcappes and vttered such a deale of stinking breath because caesar refusd the crowne that it had almost choaked caesar for hee swoonded and fell downe at it and for mine owne part i durst not laugh for feare of opening my lippes and receyuing the bad ayre cassi . but soft i pray you what did caesar swound cask . he fell downe in the marketplace and foamd at mouth and was speechlesse brut . tis very like he hath the falling sicknesse cassi . no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest caska we haue the falling sicknesse cask . i know not what you meane by that but i am sure caesar fell downe . if the tagragge people did not clap him and hisse him according as he pleasd and displeasd them as they vse to doe the players in the theatre i am no true man brut . what said he when he came vnto himselfe cask . marry before he fell downe when he perceiud the common heard was glad he refusd the crowne he pluckt me ope his doublet and offerd them his throat to cut and i had beene a man of any occupation if i would not haue taken him at a word i would i might goe to hell among the rogues and so hee fell . when he came to himselfe againe hee said if hee had done or said any thing amisse he desird their worships to thinke it was his infirmitie . three or foure wenches where i stood cryed alasse good soule and forgaue him with all their hearts but theres no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stabd their mothers they would haue done no lesse brut . and after that he came thus sad away cask . i cassi . did cicero say any thing cask . i he spoke greeke cassi . to what effect cask . nay and i tell you that ile nere looke you ith face againe . but those that vnderstood him smild at one another and shooke their heads but for mine owne part it was greeke to me . i could tell you more newes too murrellus and flauius for pulling scarffes off caesars images are put to silence . fare you well . there was more foolerie yet if i could remember it cassi . will you suppe with me to night caska cask . no i am promisd forth cassi . will you dine with me to morrow cask . i if i be aliue and your minde hold and your dinner worth the eating cassi . good i will expect you cask . doe so farewell both . enter . brut . what a blunt fellow is this growne to be he was quick mettle when he went to schoole cassi . so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprize howeuer he puts on this tardie forme this rudenesse is a sawce to his good wit which giues men stomacke to disgest his words with better appetite brut . and so it is for this time i will leaue you to morrow if you please to speake with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you cassi . i will doe so till then thinke of the world . exit brutus . well brutus thou art noble yet i see thy honorable mettle may be wrought from that it is disposd therefore it is meet that noble mindes keepe euer with their likes for who so firme that cannot be seducd caesar doth beare me hard but he loues brutus . if i were brutus now and he were cassius he should not humor me . i will this night in seuerall hands in at his windowes throw as if they came from seuerall citizens writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely caesars ambition shall be glanced at . and after this let caesar seat him sure for wee will shake him or worse dayes endure . enter . thunder and lightning . enter caska and cicero . cic . good euen caska brought you caesar home why are you breathlesse and why stare you so cask . are not you moud when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing vnfirme o cicero i haue seene tempests when the scolding winds haue riud the knottie oakes and i haue seene th ambitious ocean swell and rage and foame to be exalted with the threatning clouds but neuer till to night neuer till now did i goe through a tempestdroppingfire . eyther there is a ciuill strife in heauen or else the world too sawcie with the gods incenses them to send destruction cic . why saw you any thing more wonderfull cask . a common slaue you know him well by sight held vp his left hand which did flame and burne like twentie torches ioynd and yet his hand not sensible of fire remaind vnscorchd . besides i ha not since put vp my sword against the capitoll i met a lyon who glazd vpon me and went surly by without annoying me . and there were drawne vpon a heape a hundred gastly women transformed with their feare who swore they saw men all in fire walke vp and downe the streetes . and yesterday the bird of night did sit euen at nooneday vpon the market place howting and shreeking . when these prodigies doe so conioyntly meet let not men say these are their reasons they are naturall for i beleeue they are portentous things vnto the clymate that they point vpon cic . indeed it is a strange disposed time but men may construe things after their fashion cleane from the purpose of the things themselues . comes caesar to the capitoll to morrow cask . he doth for he did bid antonio send word to you he would be there to morrow cic . goodnight then caska this disturbed skie is not to walke in cask . farewell cicero . exit cicero . enter cassius . cassi . whos there cask . a romane cassi . caska by your voyce cask . your eare is good . cassius what night is this cassi . a very pleasing night to honest men cask . who euer knew the heauens menace so cassi . those that haue knowne the earth so full of faults . for my part i haue walkd about the streets submitting me vnto the perillous night and thus vnbraced caska as you see haue bard my bosome to the thunderstone and when the crosse blew lightning seemd to open the brest of heauen i did present my selfe euen in the ayme and very flash of it cask . but wherefore did you so much tempt the heauens it is the part of men to feare and tremble when the most mightie gods by tokens send such dreadfull heraulds to astonish vs cassi . you are dull caska and those sparkes of life that should be in a roman you doe want or else you vse not . you looke pale and gaze and put on feare and cast your selfe in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heauens but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts why birds and beasts from qualitie and kinde why old men fooles and children calculate why all these things change from their ordinance their natures and preformed faculties to monstrous qualitie why you shall finde that heauen hath infusd them with these spirits to make them instruments of feare and warning vnto some monstrous state . now could i caska name to thee a man most like this dreadfull night that thunders lightens opens graues and roares as doth the lyon in the capitoll a man no mightier then thy selfe or me in personall action yet prodigious growne and fearefull as these strange eruptions are cask . tis caesar that you meane is it not cassius cassi . let it be who it is for romans now haue thewes and limbes like to their ancestors but woe the while our fathers mindes are dead and we are gouernd with our mothers spirits our yoake and sufferance shew vs womanish cask . indeed they say the senators to morrow meane to establish caesar as a king and he shall weare his crowne by sea and land in euery place saue here in italy cassi . i know where i will weare this dagger then cassius from bondage will deliuer cassius therein yee gods you make the weake most strong therein yee gods you tyrants doe defeat . nor stonie tower nor walls of beaten brasse nor ayrelesse dungeon nor strong linkes of iron can be retentiue to the strength of spirit but life being wearie of these worldly barres neuer lacks power to dismisse it selfe . if i know this know all the world besides that part of tyrannie that i doe beare i can shake off at pleasure . thunder still . cask . so can i so euery bondman in his owne hand beares the power to cancell his captiuitie cassi . and why should cæsar be a tyrant then poore man i know he would not be a wolfe but that he sees the romans are but sheepe he were no lyon were not romans hindes . those that with haste will make a mightie fire begin it with weake strawes . what trash is rome what rubbish and what offall when it serues for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar . but oh griefe where hast thou led me i perhaps speake this before a willing bondman then i know my answere must be made . but i am armd and dangers are to me indifferent cask . you speake to caska and to such a man that is no flearing telltale . hold my hand be factious for redresse of all these griefes and i will set this foot of mine as farre as who goes farthest cassi . theres a bargaine made . now know you caska i haue moud already some certaine of the noblest minded romans to vndergoe with me an enterprize of honorable dangerous consequence and i doe know by this they stay for me in pompeyes porch for now this fearefull night there is no stirre or walking in the streetes and the complexion of the element is fauors like the worke we haue in hand most bloodie fierie and most terrible . enter cinna . caska . stand close a while for heere comes one in haste cassi . tis cinna i doe know him by his gate he is a friend . cinna where haste you so cinna . to finde out you whos that metellus cymber cassi . no it is caska one incorporate to our attempts . am i not stayd for cinna cinna . i am glad ont . what a fearefull night is this theres two or three of vs haue seene strange sights cassi . am i not stayd for tell me cinna . yes you are . o cassius if you could but winne the noble brutus to our party cassi . be you content . good cinna take this paper and looke you lay it in the pretors chayre where brutus may but finde it and throw this in at his window set this vp with waxe vpon old brutus statue all this done repaire to pompeyes porch where you shall finde vs .  is decius brutus and trebonius there cinna . all but metellus cymber and hees gone to seeke you at your house . well i will hie and so bestow these papers as you bad me cassi . that done repayre to pompeyes theater . exit cinna . come caska you and i will yet ere day see brutus at his house three parts of him is ours alreadie and the man entire vpon the next encounter yeelds him ours cask . o he sits high in all the peoples hearts and that which would appeare offence in vs his countenance like richest alchymie will change to vertue and to worthinesse cassi . him and his worth and our great need of him you haue right well conceited let vs goe for it is after midnight and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him . exeunt . actus secundus . enter brutus in his orchard . brut . what lucius hoe i cannot by the progresse of the starres giue guesse how neere to day lucius i say i would it were my fault to sleepe so soundly . when lucius when awake i say what lucius enter lucius . luc . calld you my lord brut . get me a tapor in my study lucius when it is lighted come and call me here luc . i will my lord . enter . brut . it must be by his death and for my part i know no personall cause to spurne at him but for the generall . he would be crownd how that might change his nature theres the question it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craues warie walking crowne him that and then i graunt we put a sting in him that at his will he may doe danger with . th abuse of greatnesse is when it disioynes remorse from power and to speake truth of caesar i haue not knowne when his affections swayd more then his reason . but tis a common proofe that lowlynesse is young ambitions ladder whereto the climber vpward turnes his face but when he once attaines the vpmost round he then vnto the ladder turnes his backe lookes in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend so caesar may then least he may preuent . and since the quarrell will beare no colour for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would runne to these and these extremities and therefore thinke him as a serpents egge which hatchd would as his kinde grow mischieuous and kill him in the shell . enter lucius . luc . the taper burneth in your closet sir searching the window for a flint i found this paper thus seald vp and i am sure it did not lye there when i went to bed . giues him the letter . brut . get you to bed againe it is not day is not to morrow boy the first of march luc . i know not sir brut . looke in the calender and bring me word luc . i will sir . enter . brut . the exhalations whizzing in the ayre giue so much light that i may reade by them . opens the letter and reades . brutus thou sleepst awake and see thy selfe shall rome c .  speake strike redresse . brutus thou sleepst awake . such instigations haue beene often dropt where i haue tooke them vp shall rome c .  thus must i piece it out shall rome stand vnder one mans awe what rome my ancestors did from the streetes of rome the tarquin driue when he was calld a king . speake strike redresse . am i entreated to speake and strike o rome i make thee promise if the redresse will follow thou receiuest thy full petition at the hand of brutus . enter lucius . luc . sir march is wasted fifteene dayes . knocke within . brut . tis good . go to the gate some body knocks since cassius first did whet me against caesar i haue not slept . betweene the acting of a dreadfull thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dreame the genius and the mortall instruments are then in councell and the state of a man like to a little kingdome suffers then the nature of an insurrection . enter lucius . luc . sir tis your brother cassius at the doore who doth desire to see you brut . is he alone luc . no sir there are moe with him brut . doe you know them luc . no sir their hats are pluckt about their eares and halfe their faces buried in their cloakes that by no meanes i may discouer them by any marke of fauour brut . let em enter they are the faction . o conspiracie shamst thou to shew thy dangrous brow by night when euills are most free o then by day where wilt thou finde a cauerne darke enough to maske thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracie hide it in smiles and affabilitie for if thou path thy natiue semblance on not erebus it selfe were dimme enough to hide thee from preuention . enter the conspirators cassius caska decius cinna metellus and trebonius . cass . i thinke we are too bold vpon your rest good morrow brutus doe we trouble you brut . i haue beene vp this howre awake all night know i these men that come along with you cass . yes euery man of them and no man here but honors you and euery one doth wish you had but that opinion of your selfe which euery noble roman beares of you . this is trebonius brut . he is welcome hither cass . this decius brutus brut . he is welcome too cass . this caska this cinna and this metellus cymber brut . they are all welcome . what watchfull cares doe interpose themselues betwixt your eyes and night cass . shall i entreat a word they whisper . decius . here lyes the east doth not the day breake heere cask . no cin . o pardon sir it doth and yon grey lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day cask . you shall confesse that you are both deceiud heere as i point my sword the sunne arises which is a great way growing on the south weighing the youthfull season of the yeare . some two moneths hence vp higher toward the north he first presents his fire and the high east stands as the capitoll directly heere bru . giue me your hands all ouer one by one cas . and let vs sweare our resolution brut . no not an oath if not the face of men the sufferance of our soules the times abuse if these be motiues weake breake off betimes and euery man hence to his idle bed so let highsightedtyranny range on till each man drop by lottery . but if these as i am sure they do beare fire enough to kindle cowards and to steele with valour the melting spirits of women . then countrymen what neede we any spurre but our owne cause to pricke vs to redresse what other bond then secret romans that haue spoke the word and will not palter and what other oath then honesty to honesty ingagd that this shall be or we will fall for it . sweare priests and cowards and men cautelous old feeble carrions and such suffering soules that welcome wrongs vnto bad causes sweare such creatures as men doubt but do not staine the euen vertue of our enterprize nor th insuppressiue mettle of our spirits to thinke that or our cause or our performance did neede an oath . when euery drop of blood that euery roman beares and nobly beares is guilty of a seuerall bastardie if he do breake the smallest particle of any promise that hath past from him cas . but what of cicero shall we sound him i thinke he will stand very strong with vs cask . let vs not leaue him out cyn . no by no meanes metel . o let vs haue him for his siluer haires will purchase vs a good opinion and buy mens voyces to commend our deeds it shall be sayd his iudgement ruld our hands our youths and wildenesse shall no whit appeare but all be buried in his grauity bru . o name him not let vs not breake with him for he will neuer follow any thing that other men begin cas . then leaue him out cask . indeed he is not fit decius . shall no man else be toucht but onely caesar cas . decius well vrgd i thinke it is not meet marke antony so well beloud of caesar should outliue caesar we shall finde of him a shrewd contriuer . and you know his meanes if he improue them may well stretch so farre as to annoy vs all which to preuent let antony and caesar fall together bru . our course will seeme too bloody caius cassius to cut the head off and then hacke the limbes like wrath in death and enuy afterwards for antony is but a limbe of caesar . lets be sacrificers but not butchers caius we all stand vp against the spirit of caesar and in the spirit of men there is no blood o that we then could come by caesars spirit and not dismember caesar but alas caesar must bleed for it . and gentle friends lets kill him boldly but not wrathfully lets carue him as a dish fit for the gods not hew him as a carkasse fit for hounds and let our hearts as subtle masters do stirre vp their seruants to an acte of rage and after seeme to chide em . this shall make our purpose necessary and not enuious . which so appearing to the common eyes we shall be calld purgers not murderers . and for marke antony thinke not of him for he can do no more then caesars arme when caesars head is off cas . yet i feare him for in the ingrafted loue he beares to caesar bru . alas good cassius do not thinke of him if he loue caesar all that he can do is to himselfe take thought and dye for caesar and that were much he should for he is giuen to sports to wildenesse and much company treb . there is no feare in him let him not dye for he will liue and laugh at this heereafter . clocke strikes . bru . peace count the clocke cas . the clocke hath stricken three treb . tis time to part cass . but it is doubtfull yet whether caesar will come forth to day or no for he is superstitious growne of late quite from the maine opinion he held once of fantasie of dreames and ceremonies it may be these apparant prodigies the vnaccustomd terror of this night and the perswasion of his augurers may hold him from the capitoll to day decius . neuer feare that if he be so resolud i can oresway him for he loues to heare that vnicornes may be betrayd with trees and beares with glasses elephants with holes lyons with toyles and men with flatterers . but when i tell him he hates flatterers he sayes he does being then most flattered . let me worke for i can giue his humour the true bent and i will bring him to the capitoll cas . nay we will all of vs be there to fetch him bru . by the eight houre is that the vttermost cin . be that the vttermost and faile not then met . caius ligarius doth beare caesar hard who rated him for speaking well of pompey i wonder none of you haue thought of him bru . now good metellus go along by him he loues me well and i haue giuen him reasons send him but hither and ile fashion him cas . the morning comes vpons weel leaue you brutus and friends disperse your selues but all remember what you haue said and shew your selues true romans bru . good gentlemen looke fresh and merrily let not our lookes put on our purposes but beare it as our roman actors do with

bee any in this assembly any deere friend of caesars to him i say that brutus loue to caesar was no lesse then his . if then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer not that i loud caesar lesse but that i loud rome more . had you rather caesar were liuing and dye all slaues then that caesar were dead to liue all freemen as caesar loud mee i weepe for him as he was fortunate i reioyce at it as he was valiant i honour him but as he was ambitious i slew him . there is teares for his loue ioy for his fortune honor for his valour and death for his ambition . who is heere so base that would be a bondman if any speak for him haue i offended . who is heere so rude that would not be a roman if any speak for him haue i offended . who is heere so vile that will not loue his countrey if any speake for him haue i offended . i pause for a reply all . none brutus none brutus . then none haue i offended . i haue done no more to caesar then you shall do to brutus . the question of his death is inrolld in the capitoll his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offences enforcd for which he suffered death . enter mark antony with caesars body . heere comes his body mournd by marke antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receiue the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not . with this i depart that as i

. peace hoe let vs heare him an . friends romans countrymen lend me your ears i come to bury caesar not to praise him the euill that men do liues after them the good is oft enterred with their bones so let it be with caesar . the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious if it were so it was a greeuous fault and greeuously hath caesar answerd it . heere vnder leaue of brutus and the rest for brutus is an honourable man so are they all all honourable men come i to speake in caesars funerall . he was my friend faithfull and iust to me but brutus sayes he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man . he hath brought many captiues home to rome whose ransomes did the generall coffers fill did this in caesar seeme ambitious when that the poore haue cryde caesar hath wept ambition should be made of sterner stuffe yet brutus sayes he was ambitious and brutus is an honourable man . you all did see that on the lupercall i thrice presented him a kingly crowne which he did thrice refuse . was this ambition yet brutus sayes he was ambitious and sure he is an honourable man . i speake not to disprooue what brutus spoke but heere i am to speake what i do know you all did loue him once not without cause what cause withholds you then to mourne for him o iudgement thou are fled to brutish beasts and men haue lost their reason . beare with me my heart is in the coffin there with caesar and i must pawse till it come backe to me 1 me thinkes there is much reason in his sayings 2 if thou consider rightly of the matter caesar has had great wrong 3 has hee masters i feare there will a worse come in his place 4 .  markd ye his words he would not take y crown therefore tis certaine he was not ambitious 1 .  if it be found so some will deere abide it 2 .  poore soule his eyes are red as fire with weeping 3 .  theres not a nobler man in rome then antony 4 .  now marke him he begins againe to speake ant . but yesterday the word of caesar might haue stood against the world now lies he there and none so poore to do him reuerence . o maisters if i were disposd to stirre your hearts and mindes to mutiny and rage i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong who you all know are honourable men . i will not do them wrong i rather choose to wrong the dead to wrong my selfe and you then i will wrong such honourable men . but heeres a parchment with the seale of caesar i found it in his closset tis his will let but the commons heare this testament which pardon me i do not meane to reade and they would go and kisse dead caesars wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood yea begge a haire of him for memory and dying mention it within their willes bequeathing it as a rich legacie vnto their issue 4 weel heare the will reade it marke antony all . the will the will we will heare caesars will ant . haue patience gentle friends i must not read it . it is not meete you know how caesar loud you you are not wood you are not stones but men and being men hearing the will of caesar it will inflame you it will make you mad tis good you know not that you are his heires for if you should o what would come of it 4 read the will weel heare it antony you shall reade vs the will caesars will ant . will you be patient will you stay awhile i haue oreshot my selfe to tell you of it i feare i wrong the honourable men whose daggers haue stabbd caesar i do feare it 4 they were traitors honourable men all . the will the testament 2 they were villaines murderers the will read the will ant . you will compell me then to read the will then make a ring about the corpes of caesar and let me shew you him that made the will shall i descend and will you giue me leaue all . come downe 2 descend 3 you shall haue leaue 4 a ring stand round 1 stand from the hearse stand from the body 2 roome for antony most noble antony ant . nay presse not so vpon me stand farre off all . stand backe roome beare backe ant . if you haue teares prepare to shed them now . you all do know this mantle i remember the first time euer caesar put it on twas on a summers euening in his tent that day he ouercame the neruij . looke in this place ran cassius dagger through see what a rent the enuious caska made through this the welbeloued brutus stabbd and as he pluckd his cursed steele away marke how the blood of caesar followed it as rushing out of doores to be resolud if brutus so vnkindely knockd or no for brutus as you know was caesars angel . iudge o you gods how deerely caesar loud him this was the most vnkindest cut of all . for when the noble caesar saw him stab ingratitude more strong then traitors armes quite vanquishd him then burst his mighty heart and in his mantle muffling vp his face euen at the base of pompeyes statue which all the while ran blood great caesar fell . o what a fall was there my countrymen then i and you and all of vs fell downe whilst bloody treason flourishd ouer vs .  o now you weepe and i perceiue you feele the dint of pitty these are gracious droppes . kinde soules what weepe you when you but behold our caesars vesture wounded looke you heere heere is himselfe marrd as you see with traitors 1 .  o pitteous spectacle 2 .

this deede are honourable . what priuate greefes they haue alas i know not that made them do it they are wise and honourable and will no doubt with reasons answer you . i come not friends to steale

againe assaile your eares that are so fortified against our story what we two nights haue seene hor . well sit we downe and let vs heare barnardo speake of this barn . last night of all when yond same starre thats westward from the pole had made his course t illume that part of heauen where now it burnes marcellus and my selfe the bell then beating one mar . peace breake thee of enter the ghost . looke where it comes againe barn . in the same figure like the king thats dead mar . thou art a scholler speake to it horatio barn . lookes it not like the king marke it horatio hora . most like it harrowes me with fear  wonder barn . it would be spoke too mar . question it horatio hor . what art thou that vsurpst this time of night together with that faire and warlike forme in which the maiesty of buried denmarke did sometimes march by heauen i charge thee speake mar . it is offended barn . see it stalkes away hor . stay speake speake i charge thee speake . exit the ghost . mar . tis gone and will not answer barn . how now horatio you tremble  look pale is not this something more then fantasie what thinke you ont hor . before my god i might not this beleeue without the sensible and true auouch of mine owne eyes mar . is it not like the king hor . as thou art to thy selfe such was the very armour he had on when th ambitious norwey combatted so frownd he once when in an angry parle he smot the sledded pollax on the ice . tis strange mar . thus twice before and iust at this dead houre with martiall stalke hath he gone by our watch hor . in what particular thought to work i know not but in the grosse and scope of my opinion this boades some strange erruption to our state mar . good now sit downe  tell me he that knowes why this same strict and most obseruant watch so nightly toyles the subiect of the land and why such dayly cast of brazon cannon and forraigne mart for implements of warre why such impresse of shipwrights whose sore taske dos not diuide the sunday from the weeke what might be toward that this sweaty hast doth make the night ioyntlabourer with the day who ist that can informe me hor . that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image euen but now appeard to vs was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride dard to the combate . in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our knowne world esteemd him did slay this fortinbras who by a seald compact well ratified by law and heraldrie did forfeite with his life all those his lands which he stood seizd on to the conqueror against the which a moity competent was gaged by our king which had returnd to the inheritance of fortinbras had he bin vanquisher as by the same counant and carriage of the article designe his fell to hamlet . now sir young fortinbras of vnimproued mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway heere and there sharkd vp a list of landlesse resolutes for foode and diet to some enterprize that hath a stomacke int which is no other and it doth well appeare vnto our state but to recouer of vs by strong hand and termes compulsatiue those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the maine motiue of our preparations the sourse of this our watch and the cheefe head of this posthast and romage in the land . enter ghost againe . but soft behold loe where it comes againe ile crosse it though it blast me . stay illusion if thou hast any sound or vse of voyce speake to me . if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me . if thou art priuy to thy countries fate which happily foreknowing may auoyd oh speake . or if thou hast vphoorded in thy life extorted treasure in the wombe of earth for which they say you spirits oft walke in death speake of it . stay and speake . stop it marcellus mar . shall i strike at it with my partizan hor . do if it will not stand barn . tis heere hor . tis heere mar . tis gone . exit ghost . we do it wrong being so maiesticall to offer it the shew of violence for it is as the ayre invulnerable and our vaine blowes malicious mockery barn . it was about to speake when the cocke crew hor . and then it started like a guilty thing vpon a fearfull summons . i haue heard the cocke that is the trumpet to the day doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throate awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or ayre th extrauagant and erring spirit hyes to his confine . and of the truth heerein this present obiect made probation mar . it faded on the crowing of the cocke . some sayes that euer gainst that season comes wherein our sauiours birch is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit can walke abroad the nights are wholsome then no planets strike no faiery talkes nor witch hath power to charme so hallowd and so gracious is the time hor . so haue i heard and do in part beleeue it . but looke the morne in russet mantle clad walkes ore the dew of yon high easterne hill breake we our watch vp and by my aduice let vs impart what we haue seene to night vnto yong hamlet . for vpon my life this spirit dumbe to vs will speake to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needfull in our loues fitting our duty mar . let dot i pray and i this morning know where we shall finde him most conueniently . exeunt . scena secunda . enter claudius king of denmarke gertrude the queene hamlet polonius laertes and his sister ophelia lords attendant . king . though yet of hamlet our deere brothers death the memory be greene and that it vs befitted to beare our hearts in greefe and our whole kingdome to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so farre hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow thinke on him together with remembrance of our selues . therefore our sometimes sister now our queene th imperiall ioyntresse of this warlike state haue we as twere with a defeated ioy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funerall and with dirge in marriage in equall scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor haue we heerein barrd your better wisedomes which haue freely gone with this affaire along for all our thankes . now followes that you know young fortinbras holding a weake supposall of our worth or thinking by our late deere brothers death our state to be disioynt and out of frame colleagued with the dreame of his aduantage he hath not fayld to pester vs with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother . so much for him . enter voltemand and cornelius . now for our selfe and for this time of meeting thus much the businesse is . we haue heere writ to norway vncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bedrid scarsely heares of this his nephewes purpose to suppresse his further gate heerein . in that the leuies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subiect and we heere dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearing of this greeting to old norway giuing to you no further personall power to businesse with the king more then the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your hast commend your duty volt . in that and all things will we shew our duty king . we doubt it nothing heartily farewell . exit voltemand and cornelius . and now laertes whats the newes with you you told vs of some suite . what ist laertes you cannot speake of reason to the dane and loose your voyce . what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more natiue to the heart the hand more instrumentall to the mouth then is the throne of denmarke to thy father . what wouldst thou haue laertes laer . dread my lord your leaue and fauour to returne to france from whence though willingly i came to denmarke to shew my duty in your coronation yet now i must confesse that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend againe towards france and bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon king . haue you your fathers leaue what sayes pollonius pol . he hath my lord i do beseech you giue him leaue to go king . take thy faire houre laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cosin hamlet and my sonne ham . a little more then kin and lesse then kinde king . how is it that the clouds still hang on you ham . not so my lord i am too much ith sun queen . good hamlet cast thy nightly colour off and let thine eye looke like a friend on denmarke . do not for euer with thy veyled lids seeke for thy noble father in the dust thou knowst tis common all that liues must dye passing through nature to eternity ham . i madam it is common queen . if it be why seemes it so particular with thee ham . seemes madam nay it is i know not seemes tis not alone my inky cloake good mother nor customary suites of solemne blacke nor windy suspiration of forcd breath no nor the fruitfull riuer in the eye nor the deiected hauiour of the visage together with all formes moods shewes of griefe that can denote me truly . these indeed seeme for they are actions that a man might play but i haue that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suites of woe king . tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to giue these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the suruiuer bound in filiall obligation for some terme to do obsequious sorrow . but to perseuer in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornnesse . tis vnmanly greefe it shewes a will most incorrect to heauen a heart vnfortified a minde impatient an vnderstanding simple and vnschoold for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sence why should we in our peeuish opposition take it to heart fye tis a fault to heauen a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theame is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first coarse till he that dyed to day this must be so . we pray you throw to earth this vnpreuayling woe and thinke of vs as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no lesse nobility of loue then that which deerest father beares his sonne do i impart towards you . for your intent in going backe to schoole in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remaine heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye our cheefest courtier cosin and our sonne qu . let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i prythee stay with vs go not to wittenberg ham . i shall in all my best obey you madam king . why tis a louing and a faire reply be as our selfe in denmarke . madam come this gentle and vnforcd accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no iocond health that denmarke drinkes to day but the great cannon to the clowds shall tell and the kings rouce the heauens shall bruite againe respeaking earthly thunder . come away . exeunt . manet hamlet . ham . oh that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolue it selfe into a dew or that the euerlasting had not fixt his cannon gainst selfeslaughter . o god o god how weary stale flat and vnprofitable seemes to me all the vses of this world fie ont oh fie fie tis an vnweeded garden that growes to seed things rank and grosse in nature possesse it meerely . that it should come to this but two months dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hiperion to a satyre so louing to my mother that he might not beteene the windes of heauen visit her face too roughly . heauen and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if encrease of appetite had growne by what is fed on and yet within a month let me not thinke ont frailty thy name is woman . a little month or ere those shooes were old with which she followed my poore fathers body like niobe all teares . why she euen she . o heauen a beast that wants discourse of reason would haue mournd longer married with mine vnkle my fathers brother but no more like my father then i to hercules . within a moneth ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous teares had left the flushing of her gauled eyes she married . o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot come to good . but breake my heart for i must hold my tongue . enter horatio barnardo and marcellus . hor . haile to your lordship ham . i am glad to see you well horatio or i do forget my

fathers funerall ham . i pray thee doe not mock me fellow student i thinke it was to see my mothers wedding hor . indeed my lord it followed hard vpon ham . thrift thrift horatio the funerall baktmeats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables would i had met my dearest foe in heauen ere i had euer seene that day horatio . my father me thinkes i see my father hor . oh where my lord ham

you ham . for heauens loue let me heare hor . two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and barnardo on their watch in the dead wast and middle of the night beene thus encountred . a figure like your father armd at all points exactly cap a pe appeares before them and with sollemne march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkt by their opprest and fearesurprized eyes within his truncheons length whilst they bestild almost to ielly with the act of feare stand dumbe and speake not to him . this to me in dreadfull secrecie impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch whereas they had deliuerd both in time forme of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes . i knew your father these hands are not more like ham . but where was this mar . my lord vpon the platforme where we watcht ham . did you not speake to it hor . my lord i did but answere made it none yet once me thought it lifted vp it head and did addresse it selfe to motion like as it would speake but euen then the morning cocke crew lowd and at the sound it shrunke in hast away and vanisht from our sight ham . tis very strange hor . as i doe liue my honourd lord tis true and we did thinke it writ downe in our duty to let you know of it ham . indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me . hold you the watch to night both . we doe my lord ham . armd say you both . armd my lord ham . from top to toe both . my lord from head to foote ham . then saw you not his face hor . o yes my lord he wore his beauer vp ham . what lookt he frowningly hor . a countenance more in sorrow then

. ile watch to night perchance twill wake againe hor . i warrant you it will ham . if it assume my noble fathers person ile speake to it though hell it selfe should gape and bid me hold my peace . i pray you all if you haue hitherto conceald this sight let it bee treble in your silence still and whatsoeuer els shall hap to night giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue i will requite your loues so fare ye well vpon the platforme twixt eleuen and twelue ile visit you all . our duty to your honour . exeunt ham . your loue as mine to you farewell . my fathers spirit in armes all is not well i

laer . my necessaries are imbarkt farewell and sister as the winds giue benefit and conuoy is assistant doe not sleepe but let me heare from you ophel . doe you doubt that laer . for hamlet and the trifling of his fauours hold it a fashion and a toy in bloude a violet in the youth of primy nature froward not permanent sweet not lasting the suppliance of a minute no more ophel . no more but so laer . thinke it no more for nature cressant does not grow alone in thewes and bulke but as his temple waxes the inward seruice of the minde and soule growes wide withall . perhaps he loues you now and now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch the vertue of his feare but you must feare his greatnesse weighd his will is not his owne for hee himselfe is subiect to his birth hee may not as vnuallued persons doe carue for himselfe for on his choyce depends the sanctity and health of the whole state . and therefore must his choyce be circumscribd vnto the voyce and yeelding of that body whereof he is the head . then if he sayes he loues you it fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it as he in his peculiar sect and force may giue his saying deed which is no further then the maine voyce of denmarke goes withall . then weight what losse your honour may sustaine if with too credent eare you list his songs or lose your heart or your chast treasure open to his vnmastred importunity . feare it ophelia feare it my deare sister and keepe within the reare of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire . the chariest maid is prodigall enough if she vnmaske her beauty to the moone vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before the buttons be disclosd and in the morne and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent . be wary then best safety lies in feare youth to it selfe rebels though none else neere ophe . i shall th effect of this good lesson keepe as watchmen to my heart but good my brother doe not as some vngracious pastors doe shew me the steepe and thorny way to heauen whilst like a puft and recklesse libertine himselfe the primrose path of dalliance treads and reaks not his owne reade laer . oh feare me not . enter polonius . i stay too long but here my father comes a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles vpon a second leaue polon . yet heere laertes aboord aboord for shame the winde sits in the shoulder of your saile and you are staid for there my blessing with you and these few precepts in thy memory see thou character . giue thy thoughts no tongue nor any vnproportiond thoughts his act be thou familiar but by no meanes vulgar the friends thou hast and their adoption tride grapple them to thy soule with hoopes of steele but doe not dull thy palme with entertainment of each vnhatcht vnfledgd comrade . beware of entrance to a quarrell but being in beart that th opposed may beware of thee . giue euery man thine eare but few thy voyce take each mans censure but reserue thy iudgement costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not exprest in fancie rich not gawdie for the apparell oft proclaimes the man . and they in france of the best ranck and station are of a most select and generous cheff in that . neither a borrower nor a lender be for lone oft loses both it selfe and friend and borrowing duls the edge of husbandry . this aboue all to thine owne selfe be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man . farewell my blessing season this in thee laer . most humbly doe i take my leaue my lord polon

euen in their promise as it is a making you must not take for fire . for this time daughter be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate then a command to parley

which their inuestments show but meere implorators of vnholy sutes breathing like sanctified and pious bonds the better to beguile . this is for all i would not in plaine tearmes from this time forth

me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arme and with his other hand thus ore his brow he fals to such perusall of my face as he would draw it . long staid he so at last a little shaking of mine arme and thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe he raisd a sigh so pittious and profound that it did seeme to shatter all his bulke and end his being . that done he lets me goe and with his head ouer his shoulders turnd he seemd to finde his way without his eyes for out adores he went without their helpe and to the last bended their light on me polon . goe with me i will goe seeke the king this is the very extasie of loue whose violent property foredoes it selfe and leads the will to desperate vndertakings as oft as any passion vnder heauen that does afflict our

thee speak me a speech once but it was neuer acted or if it was not aboue once for the play i remember pleasd not the million twas cauiarie to the generall but it was as i receiud it and others whose iudgement in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scoenes set downe with as much modestie as cunning . i remember one said there was no sallets in the lines to make the matter sauory nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation but cald it an honest method . one cheefe speech in it i cheefely loud twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priams slaughter . if it liue in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like thhyrcanian beast . it is not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable armes blacke as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and blacke complexion smeard with heraldry more dismall head to foote now is he to take geulles horridly trickd with blood of fathers mothers daughters sonnes bakd and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and damned light to their vilde murthers roasted in wrath and fire and thus oresized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus olde grandsire priam seekes pol . fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion 1 . player . anon he findes him striking too short at greekes . his anticke sword rebellious to his arme lyes where it falles repugnant to command

stoopes to his bace and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus eare . for loe his sword which was declining on the milkie head of reuerend priam seemd ith ayre to sticke so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a newtrall to his will and matter did nothing . but as we often see against some storme a silence in the heauens the racke stand still the bold windes speechlesse and the orbe below as hush as death anon the dreadfull thunder doth rend the region . so after pyrrhus pause a rowsed vengeance sets him new aworke and neuer did the cyclops hammers fall on mars his armours forgd for proofe eterne with lesse remorse then pyrrhus bleeding sword now falles on priam . out out thou strumpetfortune all you gods in generall synod take away her power breake all the spokes and fallies

his sword her husbands limbes the instant burst of clamour that she made vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all would haue made milche the burning eyes of heauen and passion in the gods pol .

intreate your maiesties to heare and see the matter king . with all my heart and it doth much content me to heare him so inclind . good gentlemen giue him a further edge and driue his purpose on to these delights rosin . we shall my lord . exeunt . king . sweet gertrude leaue vs too for we haue closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may there affront ophelia . her father and my selfe lawful espials will so bestow our selues that seeing vnseene we may of their encounter frankely iudge and gather by him as he is behaued ift be th affliction of his loue or no . that thus he suffers for qu . i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlets wildenesse so shall i hope your vertues will bring him to his wonted way againe to both your honors ophe . madam i wish it may pol . ophelia walke you heere . gracious so please ye we will bestow our selues reade on this booke that shew of such an exercise may colour your

my conscience the harlots cheeke beautied with plaistring art is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it then is my deede to my most painted word . oh heauie burthen pol . i heare him comming lets withdraw my lord . exeunt . enter hamlet . ham . to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the minde to suffer the slings and arrowes of outragious fortune or to take armes against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to dye to sleepe no more and by a sleepe to say we end the heartake and the thousand naturall shockes that flesh is heyre too tis a consummation deuoutly to be wishd . to dye to sleepe to sleepe perchance to dreame i theres the rub for in that sleepe of death what dreames may come when we haue shuffeld off this mortall coile must giue vs pawse . theres the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would beare the whips and scornes of time the oppressors wrong the poore mans contumely the pangs of disprizd loue the lawes delay the insolence of office and the spurnes that patient merit of the vnworthy takes when he himselfe might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would these fardles beare to grunt and sweat vnder a weary life but that the dread of something after death the vndiscouered countrey from whose borne no traueller returnes puzels the will and makes vs rather beare those illes we haue then flye to others that we know not of . thus conscience does make cowards of vs all and thus the natiue hew of resolution is sicklied ore with the pale cast of thought and enterprizes of great pith and moment with this regard their currants turne away and loose the name of action . soft you now the faire ophelia nimph in thy orizons be all my sinnes remembred ophe . good my lord how does your honor for this many a day ham . i

your beautie ophe . could beautie my lord haue better comerce then your honestie ham . i trulie for the power of beautie will sooner transforme honestie from what is to a bawd then the force of honestie can translate beautie into his likenesse . this was sometime a paradox but now the time giues it proofe . i did loue you once ophe . indeed my lord you made me beleeue so ham . you should not

breeder of sinners i am my selfe indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me . i am very prowd reuengefull ambitious with more offences

speciall reasons which may to you perhaps seeme much vnsinnowed and yet to me they are strong . the queen his mother liues almost by his lookes and for my selfe my vertue or my plague be it either which shes so coniunctiue to my life and soule that as the starre moues not but in his sphere i could not but by her . the other motiue why to a publike count i might not go is the great loue the generall gender beare him who dipping all his faults in their affection would like the spring that turneth wood to stone conuert his gyues to graces . so that my arrowes too slightly timbred for so loud a winde would haue reuerted to my bow againe and not where i had armd them laer . and so haue i a noble father lost a sister driuen into desperate tearmes who was if praises may go backe againe

choose but fall and for his death no winde of blame shall breath but euen his mother shall vncharge the practice and call it accident some two monthes hence here was a gentleman of normandy iue seene my selfe and serud against the french and they ran well on horsebacke but this gallant had witchcraft int he grew into his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as had he beene encorpst

begge your sodaine comming ore to play with him now out of this laer . why out of this my lord kin . laertes was your father deare to you or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart laer . why aske you this kin . not that i thinke you did not loue your father but that i know loue is begun by time and that i see in passages of proofe time qualifies the sparke and fire of it hamlet comes backe what would you vndertake to show your selfe your fathers sonne indeed more then in words laer . to cut his throat ith church kin . no place indeed should murder sancturize reuenge should haue no bounds but good laertes will you doe this keepe close within your chamber hamlet returnd shall know you are come home weel put on those shall praise your excellence and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gaue you bring you in fine together and wager on your heads he being remisse most generous and free from all contriuing will not peruse the foiles so that with ease

       "'emma woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence and had lived nearly twentyone years in the world with very little to distress or vex her . she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate indulgent father and had in consequence of her sisters marriage been mistress of his house from a very early period . her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short of a mother in affection . sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr .  woodhouses family less as a governess than a friend very fond of both daughters but particularly of emma . between them it was more the intimacy of sisters . even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being now long passed away they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached and emma doing just what she liked highly esteeming miss taylors judgment but directed chiefly by her own . the real evils indeed of emmas situation were the power of having rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments . the danger however was at present so unperceived that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her . sorrow camea gentle sorrowbut not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness . miss taylor married . it was miss taylors loss which first brought grief . it was on the weddingday of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance . the wedding over and the bridepeople gone her father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening . her father composed himself to sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost . the event had every promise of happiness for her friend . mr .  weston was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and pleasant manners and there was some satisfaction in considering with what selfdenying generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match but it was a black mornings work for her . the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day . she recalled her past kindnessthe kindness the affection of sixteen yearshow she had taught and how she had played with her from five years oldhow she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in healthand how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood . a large debt of gratitude was owing here but the intercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed isabellas marriage on their being left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer recollection . she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed intelligent wellinformed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family interested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself in every pleasure every scheme of hersone to whom she could speak every thought as it arose and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault . how was she to bear the changeit was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs .  weston only half a mile from them and a miss taylor in the house and with all her advantages natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude . she dearly loved her father but he was no companion for her . he could not meet her in conversation rational or playful . the evil of the actual disparity in their ages and mr .  woodhouse had not married early was much increased by his constitution and habits for having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity of mind or body he was a much older man in ways than in years and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended him at any time . her sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony being settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond her daily reach and many a long october and november evening must be struggled through at hartfield before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband and their little children to fill the house and give her pleasant society again . highbury the large and populous village almost amounting to a town to which hartfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies and name did really belong afforded her no equals . the woodhouses were first in consequence there . all looked up to them . she had many acquaintance in the place for her father was universally civil but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day . it was a melancholy change and emma could not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things till her father awoke and made it necessary to be cheerful . his spirits required support . he was a nervous man easily depressed fond of every body that he was used to and hating to part with them hating change of every kind . matrimony as the origin of change was always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughters marrying nor could ever speak of her but with compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too and from his habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield . emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him from such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner poor miss taylori wish she were here again . what a pity it is that mr .  weston ever thought of her i cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot . mr .  weston is such a goodhumoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves a good wifeand you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own a house of her ownbut where is the advantage of a house of her own this is three times as large . and you have never any odd humours my dear . how often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see uswe shall be always meeting we must begin we must go and pay wedding visit very soon . my dear how am i to get so far randalls is such a distance . i could not walk half so far . no papa nobody thought of your walking . we must go in the carriage to be sure . the carriage but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little wayand where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit they are to be put into mr .  westons stable papa . you know we have settled all that already . we talked it all over with mr .  weston last night . and as for james you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls because of his daughters being housemaid there . i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else . that was your doing papa . you got hannah that good place . nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned herjames is so obliged to you i am very glad i did think of her . it was very lucky for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account and i am sure she will make a very good servant she is a civil prettyspoken girl i have a great opinion of her . whenever i see her she always curtseys and asks me how i do in a very pretty manner and when you have had her here to do needlework i observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it . i am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will be a great comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see . whenever james goes over to see his daughter you know she will be hearing of us . he will be able to tell her how we all are . emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably through the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own . the backgammontable was placed but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary . mr .  knightley a sensible man about seven or eightandthirty was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family but particularly connected with it as the elder brother of isabellas husband . he lived about a mile from highbury was a frequent visitor and always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london . he had returned to a late dinner after some days absence and now walked up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square . it was a happy circumstance and animated mr .  woodhouse for some time . mr .  knightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good and his many inquiries after poor isabella and her children were answered most satisfactorily . when this was over mr .  woodhouse gratefully observed it is very kind of you mr .  knightley to come out at this late hour to call upon us . i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk . not at all sir . it is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire . but you must have found it very damp and dirty . i wish you may not catch cold . dirty sir look at my shoes . not a speck on them . well that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal of rain here . it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast . i wanted them to put off the wedding . by the byei have not wished you joy . being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling i have been in no hurry with my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well . how did you all behave who cried most ah poor miss taylor tis a sad business . poor mr .  and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say poor miss taylor . i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independenceat any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two . especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature said emma playfully . that is what you have in your head i knowand what you would certainly say if my father were not by . i believe it is very true my dear indeed said mr .  woodhouse with a sigh . i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome . my dearest papa you do not think i could mean you or suppose mr .  knightley to mean you . what a horrible idea oh no i meant only myself . mr .  knightley loves to find fault with me you know in a jokeit is all a joke . we always say what we like to one another . mr .  knightley in fact was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself she knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body . emma knows i never flatter her said mr .  knightley but i meant no reflection on any body . miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one . the chances are that she must be a gainer . well said emma willing to let it passyou want to hear about the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all behaved charmingly . every body was punctual every body in their best looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen . oh no we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every day . dear emma bears every thing so well said her father . but mr .  knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for . emma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles . it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion said mr .  knightley . we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylors advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylors time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure . every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married . and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said emma and a very considerable onethat i made the match myself . i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right when so many people said mr .  weston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing . mr .  knightley shook his head at her . her father fondly replied ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass . pray do not make any more matches . i promise you to make none for myself papa but i must indeed for other people . it is the greatest amusement in the world and after such success you knowevery body said that mr .  weston would never marry again . oh dear no mr .  weston who had been a widower so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful mr .  weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it . oh no mr .  weston certainly would never marry again . some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed and others of the son and the uncle not letting him . all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none of it . ever since the dayabout four years agothat miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle he darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchells i made up my mind on the subject . i planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed me in this instance dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave off matchmaking . i do not understand what you mean by success said mr .  knightley . success supposes endeavour . your time has been properly and delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage . a worthy employment for a young ladys mind but if which i rather imagine your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr .  weston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where is your merit what are you proud of you made a lucky guess and that is all that can be said . and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess i pity you . i thought you clevererfor depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck . there is always some talent in it . and as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it . you have drawn two pretty pictures but i think there may be a thirda something between the donothing and the doall . if i had not promoted mr .  westons visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all . i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that . a straightforward openhearted man like weston and a rational unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns . you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference . emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others rejoined mr .  woodhouse understanding but in part . but my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up ones family circle grievously . only one more papa only for mr .  elton . poor mr .  elton you like mr .  elton papai must look about for a wife for him . there is nobody in highbury who deserves himand he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would be a shame to have him single any longerand i thought when he was joining their hands today he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him i think very well of mr .  elton and this is the only way i have of doing him a service . mr .  elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very good young man and i have a great regard for him . but if you want to shew him any attention my dear ask him to come and dine with us some day . that will be a much better thing . i dare say mr .  knightley will be so kind as to meet him . with a great deal of pleasure sir at any time said mr .  knightley laughing and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much better thing . invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife . depend upon it a man of six or sevenandtwenty can take care of himself . chapter ii mr .  weston was a native of highbury and born of a respectable family which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property . he had received a good education but on succeeding early in life to a small independence had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied . captain weston was a general favourite and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill of a great yorkshire family and miss churchill fell in love with him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife who had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance which the connexion would offend . miss churchill however being of age and with the full command of her fortunethough her fortune bore no proportion to the familyestatewas not to be dissuaded from the marriage and it took place to the infinite mortification of mr .  and mrs .  churchill who threw her off with due decorum . it was an unsuitable connexion and did not produce much happiness . mrs .  weston ought to have found more in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit she had not the best . she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brothers unreasonable anger nor from missing the luxuries of her former home . they lived beyond their income but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe . captain weston who had been considered especially by the churchills as making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst of the bargain for when his wife died after a three years marriage he was rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain . from the expense of the child however he was soon relieved . the boy had with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mothers been the means of a sort of reconciliation and mr .  and mrs .  churchill having no children of their own nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease . some scruples and some reluctance the widowerfather may be supposed to have felt but as they were overcome by other considerations the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills and he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to improve as he could . a complete change of life became desirable . he quitted the militia and engaged in trade having brothers already established in a good way in london which afforded him a favourable opening . it was a concern which brought just employment enough . he had still a small house in highbury where most of his leisure days were spent and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away . he had by that time realised an easy competenceenough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury which he had always longed forenough to marry a woman as portionless even as miss taylor and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition . it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase randalls and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to but he had gone steadily on with these objects in view till they were accomplished . he had made his fortune bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new period of existence with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through . he had never been an unhappy man his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage but his second must shew him how delightful a welljudging and truly amiable woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen to excite gratitude than to feel it . he had only himself to please in his choice his fortune was his own for as to frank it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncles heir it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age . it was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his fathers assistance . his father had no apprehension of it . the aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely but it was not in mr .  westons nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed so deservedly dear . he saw his son every year in london and was proud of him and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too . he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern . mr .  frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life . his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved . now upon his fathers marriage it was very generally proposed as a most proper attention that the visit should take place . there was not a dissentient voice on the subject either when mrs .  perry drank tea with mrs .  and miss bates or when mrs .  and miss bates returned the visit . now was the time for mr .  frank churchill to come among them and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion . for a few days every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs .  weston had received . i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr .  frank churchill has written to mrs .  weston i understand it was a very handsome letter indeed . mr .  woodhouse told me of it . mr .  woodhouse saw the letter and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life . it was indeed a highly prized letter . mrs .  weston had of course formed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured . she felt herself a most fortunate woman and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled and who could ill bear to part with her . she knew that at times she must be missed and could not think without pain of emmas losing a single pleasure or suffering an hours ennui from the want of her companionableness but dear emma was of no feeble character she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been and had sense and energy and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations . and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield so convenient for even solitary female walking and in mr .  westons disposition and circumstances which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together . her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to mrs .  weston and of moments only of regret and her satisfactionher more than satisfactionher cheerful enjoyment was so just and so apparent that emma well as she knew her father was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity poor miss taylor when they left her at randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own . but never did she go without mr .  woodhouses giving a gentle sigh and saying ah poor miss taylor she would be very glad to stay . there was no recovering miss taylornor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her but a few weeks brought some alleviation to mr .  woodhouse . the compliments of his neighbours were over he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event and the weddingcake which had been a great distress to him was all eat up . his own stomach could bear nothing rich and he could never believe other people to be different from himself . what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body and he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any weddingcake at all and when that proved vain as earnestly tried to prevent any bodys eating it . he had been at the pains of consulting mr .  perry the apothecary on the subject . mr .  perry was an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of mr .  woodhouses life and upon being applied to he could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination that weddingcake might certainly disagree with manyperhaps with most people unless taken moderately . with such an opinion in confirmation of his own mr .  woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair but still the cake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone . there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being seen with a slice of mrs .  westons weddingcake in their hands but mr .  woodhouse would never believe it . chapter iii mr .  woodhouse was fond of society in his own way . he liked very much to have his friends come and see him and from various united causes from his long residence at hartfield and his good nature from his fortune his house and his daughter he could command the visits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked . he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle his horror of late hours and large dinnerparties made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms . fortunately for him highbury including randalls in the same parish and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining the seat of mr .  knightley comprehended many such . not unfrequently through emmas persuasion he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening parties were what he preferred and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a cardtable for him . real longstanding regard brought the westons and mr .  knightley and by mr .  elton a young man living alone without liking it the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr .  woodhouses drawingroom and the smiles of his lovely daughter was in no danger of being thrown away . after these came a second set among the most comeatable of whom were mrs .  and miss bates and mrs .  goddard three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield and who were fetched and carried home so often that mr .  woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses . had it taken place only once a year it would have been a grievance . mrs .  bates the widow of a former vicar of highbury was a very old lady almost past every thing but tea and quadrille . she lived with her single daughter in a very small way and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady under such untoward circumstances can excite . her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young handsome rich nor married . miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect . she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness . her youth had passed without distinction and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible . and yet she was a happy woman and a woman whom no one named without goodwill . it was her own universal goodwill and contented temper which worked such wonders . she loved every body was interested in every bodys happiness quicksighted to every bodys merits thought herself a most fortunate creature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother and so many good neighbours and friends and a home that wanted for nothing . the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature her contented and grateful spirit were a recommendation to every body and a mine of felicity to herself . she was a great talker upon little matters which exactly suited mr .  woodhouse full of trivial communications and harmless gossip . mrs .  goddard was the mistress of a schoolnot of a seminary or an establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of refined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality upon new principles and new systemsand where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanitybut a real honest oldfashioned boardingschool where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price and where girls might be sent to be out of the way and scramble themselves into a little education without any danger of coming back prodigies . mrs .  goddards school was in high reputeand very deservedly for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot she had an ample house and garden gave the children plenty of wholesome food let them run about a great deal in the summer and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands . it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church . she was a plain motherly kind of woman who had worked hard in her youth and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a teavisit and having formerly owed much to mr .  woodhouses kindness felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour hung round with fancywork whenever she could and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside . these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect and happy was she for her fathers sake in the power though as far as she was herself concerned it was no remedy for the absence of mrs .  weston . she was delighted to see her father look comfortable and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated . as she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day a note was brought from mrs .  goddard requesting in most respectful terms to be allowed to bring miss smith with her a most welcome request for miss smith was a girl of seventeen whom emma knew very well by sight and had long felt an interest in on account of her beauty . a very gracious invitation was returned and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion . harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody . somebody had placed her several years back at mrs .  goddards school and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlourboarder . this was all that was generally known of her history . she had no visible friends but what had been acquired at highbury and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her . she was a very pretty girl and her beauty happened to be of a sort which emma particularly admired . she was short plump and fair with a fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features and a look of great sweetness and before the end of the evening emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person and quite determined to continue the acquaintance . she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smiths conversation but she found her altogether very engagingnot inconveniently shy not unwilling to talkand yet so far from pushing shewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement . encouragement should be given . those soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions . the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her . the friends from whom she had just parted though very good sort of people must be doing her harm . they were a family of the name of martin whom emma well knew by character as renting a large farm of mr .  knightley and residing in the parish of donwellvery creditably she believedshe knew mr .  knightley thought highly of thembut they must be coarse and unpolished and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect . she would notice her she would improve her she would detach her from her bad acquaintance and introduce her into good society she would form her opinions and her manners . it would be an interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking highly becoming her own situation in life her leisure and powers . she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking and listening and forming all these schemes in the inbetweens that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate and the suppertable which always closed such parties and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware . with an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively with the real goodwill of a mind delighted with its own ideas did she then do all the honours of the meal and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests . upon such occasions poor mr .  woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare . he loved to have the cloth laid because it had been the fashion of his youth but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat . such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could with thorough selfapprobation recommend though he might constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things to say mrs .  bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs . an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome . serle understands boiling an egg better than any body . i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you seeone of our small eggs will not hurt you . miss bates let emma help you to a little bit of tarta very little bit . ours are all appletarts . you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here . i do not advise the custard . mrs .  goddard what say you to half a glass of wine a small halfglass put into a tumbler of water i do not think it could disagree with you . emma allowed her father to talkbut supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy . the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions . miss woodhouse was so great a personage in highbury that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure but the humble grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated her all the evening and actually shaken hands with her at last chapter iv harriet smiths intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing . quick and decided in her ways emma lost no time in inviting encouraging and telling her to come very often and as their acquaintance increased so did their satisfaction in each other . as a walking companion emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her . in that respect mrs .  westons loss had been important . her father never went beyond the shrubbery where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk or his short as the year varied and since mrs .  westons marriage her exercise had been too much confined . she had ventured once alone to randalls but it was not pleasant and a harriet smith therefore one whom she could summon at any time to a walk would be a valuable addition to her privileges . but in every respect as she saw more of her she approved her and was confirmed in all her kind designs . harriet certainly was not clever but she had a sweet docile grateful disposition was totally free from conceit and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to . her early attachment to herself was very amiable and her inclination for good company and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that there was no want of taste though strength of understanding must not be expected . altogether she was quite convinced of harriet smiths being exactly the young friend she wantedexactly the something which her home required . such a friend as mrs .  weston was out of the question . two such could never be granted . two such she did not want . it was quite a different sort of thing a sentiment distinct and independent . mrs .  weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem . harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful . for mrs .  weston there was nothing to be done for harriet every thing . her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents but harriet could not tell . she was ready to tell every thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain . emma was obliged to fancy what she likedbut she could never believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered the truth . harriet had no penetration . she had been satisfied to hear and believe just what mrs .  goddard chose to tell her and looked no farther . mrs .  goddard and the teachers and the girls and the affairs of the school in general formed naturally a great part of the conversationand but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbeymill farm it must have been the whole . but the martins occupied her thoughts a good deal she had spent two very happy months with them and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place . emma encouraged her talkativenessamused by such a picture of another set of beings and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of mrs .  martins having two parlours two very good parlours indeed one of them quite as large as mrs .  goddards drawingroom and of her having an upper maid who had lived fiveandtwenty years with her and of their having eight cows two of them alderneys and one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch cow indeed and of mrs .  martins saying as she was so fond of it it should be called her cow and of their having a very handsome summerhouse in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink teaa very handsome summerhouse large enough to hold a dozen people . for some time she was amused without thinking beyond the immediate cause but as she came to understand the family better other feelings arose . she had taken up a wrong idea fancying it was a mother and daughter a son and sons wife who all lived together but when it appeared that the mr .  martin who bore a part in the narrative and was always mentioned with approbation for his great goodnature in doing something or other was a single man that there was no young mrs .  martin no wife in the case she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness and that if she were not taken care of she might be required to sink herself forever . with this inspiriting notion her questions increased in number and meaning and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr .  martin and there was evidently no dislike to it . harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very goodhumoured and obliging . he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts because she had said how fond she was of them and in every thing else he was so very obliging . he had his shepherds son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her . she was very fond of singing . he could sing a little himself . she believed he was very clever and understood every thing . he had a very fine flock and while she was with them he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country . she believed every body spoke well of him . his mother and sisters were very fond of him . mrs .  martin had told her one day and there was a blush as she said it that it was impossible for any body to be a better son and therefore she was sure whenever he married he would make a good husband . not that she wanted him to marry . she was in no hurry at all . well done mrs .  martin thought emma . you know what you are about . and when she had come away mrs .  martin was so very kind as to send mrs .  goddard a beautiful goosethe finest goose mrs .  goddard had ever seen . mrs .  goddard had dressed it on a sunday and asked all the three teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson to sup with her . mr .  martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business he does not read oh yesthat is noi do not knowbut i believe he has read a good dealbut not what you would think any thing of . he reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay in one of the window seatsbut he reads all them to himself . but sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining . and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield . he never read the romance of the forest nor the children of the abbey . he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can . the next question was what sort of looking man is mr .  martin oh not handsomenot at all handsome . i thought him very plain at first but i do not think him so plain now . one does not you know after a time . but did you never see him he is in highbury every now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston . he has passed you very often . that may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without having any idea of his name . a young farmer whether on horseback or on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity . the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do . a degree or two lower and a creditable appearance might interest me i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other . but a farmer can need none of my help and is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every other he is below it . to be sure . oh yes it is not likely you should ever have observed him but he knows you very well indeedi mean by sight . i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man . i know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well . what do you imagine his age to be he was fourandtwenty the 8th of last june and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a days differencewhich is very odd . only fourandtwenty . that is too young to settle . his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry . they seem very comfortable as they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him she would probably repent it . six years hence if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own with a little money it might be very desirable . six years hence dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not born to an independence . mr .  martin i imagine has his fortune entirely to makecannot be at all beforehand with the world . whatever money he might come into when his father died whatever his share of the family property it is i dare say all afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though with diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet . to be sure so it is . but they live very comfortably . they have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing and mrs .  martin talks of taking a boy another year . i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does marryi mean as to being acquainted with his wifefor though his sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice . the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates . there can be no doubt of your being a gentlemans daughter and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you . yes to be sure i suppose there are . but while i visit at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse i am not afraid of what any body can do . you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet but i would have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse . i want to see you permanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore i say that if you should still be in this country when mr .  martin marries i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters to be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere farmers daughter without education . to be sure . yes . not that i think mr .  martin would ever marry any body but what had had some educationand been very well brought up . however i do not mean to set up my opinion against yoursand i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife . i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth and should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well educated as me . but if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly i had better not visit her if i can help it . emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech and saw no alarming symptoms of love . the young man had been the first admirer but she trusted there was no other hold and that there would be no serious difficulty on harriets side to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own . they met mr .  martin the very next day as they were walking on the donwell road . he was on foot and after looking very respectfully at her looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion . emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey and walking a few yards forward while they talked together soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr .  robert martin . his appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible young man but his person had no other advantage and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in harriets inclination . harriet was not insensible of manner she had voluntarily noticed her fathers gentleness with admiration as well as wonder . mr .  martin looked as if he did not know what manner was . they remained but a few minutes together as miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting and harriet then came running to her with a smiling face and in a flutter of spirits which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose . only think of our happening to meet himhow very odd it was quite a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls . he did not think we ever walked this road . he thought we walked towards randalls most days . he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet . he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again tomorrow . so very odd we should happen to meet well miss woodhouse is he like what you expected what do you think of him do you think him so very plain he is very plain undoubtedlyremarkably plainbut that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility . i had no right to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air . i had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility . to be sure said harriet in a mortified voice he is not so genteel as real gentlemen . i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr .  martin . at hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated well bred men . i should be surprized if after seeing them you could be in company with mr .  martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creatureand rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before . do not you begin to feel that now were not you struck i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated as i stood here . certainly he is not like mr .  knightley . he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr .  knightley . i see the difference plain enough . but mr .  knightley is so very fine a man mr .  knightleys air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr .  martin with him . you might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in mr .  knightley . but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to . what say you to mr .  weston and mr .  elton compare mr .  martin with either of them . compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking of being silent . you must see the difference . oh yesthere is a great difference . but mr .  weston is almost an old man . mr .  weston must be between forty and fifty . which makes his good manners the more valuable . the older a person grows harriet the more important it is that their manners should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or awkwardness becomes . what is passable in youth is detestable in later age . mr .  martin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at mr .  westons time of life there is no saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly . but there may be pretty good guessing . he will be a completely gross vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking of nothing but profit and loss . will he indeed that will be very bad . how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended . he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing elsewhich is just as it should be for a thriving man . what has he to do with books and i have no doubt that he will thrive and be a very rich man in timeand his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us . i wonder he did not remember the bookwas all harriets answer and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might be safely left to itself . she therefore said no more for some time . her next beginning was in one respect perhaps mr .  eltons manners are superior to mr .  knightleys or mr .  westons . they have more gentleness . they might be more safely held up as a pattern . there is an openness a quickness almost a bluntness in mr .  weston which every body likes in him because there is so much goodhumour with itbut that would not do to be copied . neither would mr .  knightleys downright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits him very well his figure and look and situation in life seem to allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him he would not be sufferable . on the contrary i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr .  elton as a model . mr .  elton is goodhumoured cheerful obliging and gentle . he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late . i do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be . if he means any thing it must be to please you . did not i tell you what he said of you the other day she then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from mr .  elton and now did full justice to and harriet blushed and smiled and said she had always thought mr .  elton very agreeable . mr .  elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young farmer out of harriets head . she thought it would be an excellent match and only too palpably desirable natural and probable for her to have much merit in planning it . she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict . it was not likely however that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of harriets coming to hartfield . the longer she considered it the greater was her sense of its expediency . mr .  eltons situation was most suitable quite the gentleman himself and without low connexions at the same time not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet . he had a comfortable home for her and emma imagined a very sufficient income for though the vicarage of highbury was not large he was known to have some independent property and she thought very highly of him as a goodhumoured wellmeaning respectable young man without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world . she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful girl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at hartfield was foundation enough on his side and on harriets there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy . and he was really a very pleasing young man a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like . he was reckoned very handsome his person much admired in general though not by her there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense withbut the girl who could be gratified by a robert martins riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by mr .  eltons admiration . chapter v i do not know what your opinion may be mrs .  weston said mr .  knightley of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith but i think it a bad thing . a bad thing do you really think it a bad thingwhy so i think they will neither of them do the other any good . you surprize me emma must do harriet good and by supplying her with a new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good . i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure . how very differently we feelnot think they will do each other any good this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about emma mr .  knightley . perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you knowing weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle . mr .  weston would undoubtedly support me if he were here for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject . we were speaking of it only yesterday and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with . mr .  knightley i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case . you are so much used to live alone that you do not know the value of a companion and perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex after being used to it all her life . i can imagine your objection to harriet smith . she is not the superior young woman which emmas friend ought to be . but on the other hand as emma wants to see her better informed it will be an inducement to her to read more herself . they will read together . she means it i know . emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old . i have seen a great many lists of her drawingup at various times of books that she meant to read regularly throughand very good lists they werevery well chosen and very neatly arrangedsometimes alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule . the list she drew up when only fourteeni remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit that i preserved it some time and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now . but i have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma . she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding . where miss taylor failed to stimulate i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do nothing . you never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished . you know you could not . i dare say replied mrs .  weston smiling that i thought so thenbut since we have parted i can never remember emmas omitting to do any thing i wished . there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as thatsaid mr .  knightley feelingly and for a moment or two he had done . but i he soon added who have had no such charm thrown over my senses must still see hear and remember . emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family . at ten years old she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen . she was always quick and assured isabella slow and diffident . and ever since she was twelve emma has been mistress of the house and of you all . in her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her . she inherits her mothers talents and must have been under subjection to her . i should have been sorry mr .  knightley to be dependent on your recommendation had i quitted mr .  woodhouses family and wanted another situation i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body . i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held . yes said he smiling . you are better placed here very fit for a wife but not at all for a governess . but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield . you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise but you were receiving a very good education from her on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will and doing as you were bid and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife i should certainly have named miss taylor . thank you . there will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as mr .  weston . why to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne . we will not despair however . weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort or his son may plague him . i hope not that . it is not likely . no mr .  knightley do not foretell vexation from that quarter . not i indeed . i only name possibilities . i do not pretend to emmas genius for foretelling and guessing . i hope with all my heart the young man may be a weston in merit and a churchill in fortune . but harriet smithi have not half done about harriet smith . i think her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have . she knows nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing . she is a flatterer in all her ways and so much the worse because undesigned . her ignorance is hourly flattery . how can emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself while harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority and as for harriet i will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance . hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to . she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home . i am much mistaken if emmas doctrines give any strength of mind or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life . they only give a little polish . i either depend more upon emmas good sense than you do or am more anxious for her present comfort for i cannot lament the acquaintance . how well she looked last night oh you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you very well i shall not attempt to deny emmas being pretty . pretty say beautiful rather . can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than emma altogetherface and figure i do not know what i could imagine but i confess that i have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . but i am a partial old friend . such an eyethe true hazle eyeand so brilliant regular features open countenance with a complexion oh what a bloom of full health and such a pretty height and size such a firm and upright figure there is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head her glance . one hears sometimes of a child being the picture of health now emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grownup health . she is loveliness itself . mr .  knightley is not she i have not a fault to find with her person he replied . i think her all you describe . i love to look at her and i will add this praise that i do not think her personally vain . considering how very handsome she is she appears to be little occupied with it her vanity lies another way . mrs .  weston i am not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith or my dread of its doing them both harm . and i mr .  knightley am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm . with all dear emmas little faults she is an excellent creature . where shall we see a better daughter or a kinder sister or a truer friend no no she has qualities which may be trusted she will never lead any one really wrong she will make no lasting blunder where emma errs once she is in the right a hundred times . very well i will not plague you any more . emma shall be an angel and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john and isabella . john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection and isabella always thinks as he does except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children . i am sure of having their opinions with me . i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind but excuse me mr .  knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emmas mother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think any possible good can arise from harriet smiths intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you . pray excuse me but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it cannot be expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself . it has been so many years my province to give advice that you cannot be surprized mr .  knightley at this little remains of office . not at all cried he i am much obliged to you for it . it is very good advice and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found for it shall be attended to . mrs .  john knightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy about her sister . be satisfied said he i will not raise any outcry . i will keep my illhumour to myself . i have a very sincere interest in emma . isabella does not seem more my sister has never excited a greater interest perhaps hardly so great . there is an anxiety a curiosity in what one feels for emma . i wonder what will become of her so do i said mrs .  weston gently very much . she always declares she will never marry which of course means just nothing at all . but i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for . it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object . i should like to see emma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good . but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her and she goes so seldom from home . there does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present said mrs .  weston as can well be and while she is so happy at hartfield i cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor mr .  woodhouses account . i do not recommend matrimony at present to emma though i mean no slight to the state i assure you . part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and mr .  westons on the subject as much as possible . there were wishes at randalls respecting emmas destiny but it was not desirable to have them suspected and the quiet transition which mr .  knightley soon afterwards made to what does weston think of the weather shall we have rain convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield . chapter vi emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriets fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of mr .  eltons being a remarkably handsome man with most agreeable manners and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on harriets side as there could be any occasion for . she was quite convinced of mr .  eltons being in the fairest way of falling in love if not in love already . she had no scruple with regard to him . he talked of harriet and praised her so warmly that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add . his perception of the striking improvement of harriets manner since her introduction at hartfield was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment . you have given miss smith all that she required said he you have made her graceful and easy . she was a beautiful creature when she came to you but in my opinion the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature . i am glad you think i have been useful to her but harriet only wanted drawing out and receiving a few very few hints . she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself . i have done very little . if it were admissible to contradict a lady said the gallant mr .  elton i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before . exactly so that is what principally strikes me . so much superadded decision of character skilful has been the hand great has been the pleasure i am sure . i never met with a disposition more truly amiable . i have no doubt of it . and it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation which had a vast deal of the lover . she was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers to have harriets picture . did you ever have your likeness taken harriet said she did you ever sit for your picture harriet was on the point of leaving the room and only stopt to say with a very interesting naivete oh dear no never . no sooner was she out of sight than emma exclaimed what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be i would give any money for it . i almost long to attempt her likeness myself . you do not know it i dare say but two or three years ago i had a great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of my friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general . but from one cause or another i gave it up in disgust . but really i could almost venture if harriet would sit to me . it would be such a delight to have her picture let me entreat you cried mr .  elton it would indeed be a delight let me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend . i know what your drawings are . how could you suppose me ignorant is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs .  weston some inimitable figurepieces in her drawingroom at randalls yes good manthought emmabut what has all that to do with taking likenesses you know nothing of drawing . dont pretend to be in raptures about mine . keep your raptures for harriets face . well if you give me such kind encouragement mr .  elton i believe i shall try what i can do . harriets features are very delicate which makes a likeness difficult and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch . exactly sothe shape of the eye and the lines about the mouthi have not a doubt of your success . pray pray attempt it . as you will do it it will indeed to use your own words be an exquisite possession . but i am afraid mr .  elton harriet will not like to sit . she thinks so little of her own beauty . did not you observe her manner of answering me how completely it meant why should my picture be drawn oh yes i observed it i assure you . it was not lost on me . but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded . harriet was soon back again and the proposal almost immediately made and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others . emma wished to go to work directly and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits for not one of them had ever been finished that they might decide together on the best size for harriet . her many beginnings were displayed . miniatures halflengths wholelengths pencil crayon and watercolours had been all tried in turn . she had always wanted to do every thing and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to . she played and sangand drew in almost every style but steadiness had always been wanting and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command and ought not to have failed of . she was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician but she was not unwilling to have others deceived or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved . there was merit in every drawingin the least finished perhaps the most her style was spirited but had there been much less or had there been ten times more the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same . they were both in ecstasies . a likeness pleases every body and miss woodhouses performances must be capital . no great variety of faces for you said emma . i had only my own family to study from . there is my fatheranother of my fatherbut the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous that i could only take him by stealth neither of them very like therefore . mrs .  weston again and again and again you see . dear mrs .  weston always my kindest friend on every occasion . she would sit whenever i asked her . there is my sister and really quite her own little elegant figureand the face not unlike . i should have made a good likeness of her if she would have sat longer but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet . then here come all my attempts at three of those four childrenthere they are henry and john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other and any one of them might do for any one of the rest . she was so eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them beyond the air and complexion unless they are coarser featured than any of mamas children ever were . here is my sketch of the fourth who was a baby . i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see . he had nestled down his head most conveniently . thats very like . i am rather proud of little george . the corner of the sofa is very good . then here is my lastunclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size wholelengthmy last and my bestmy brother mr .  john knightley . this did not want much of being finished when i put it away in a pet and vowed i would never take another likeness . i could not help being provoked for after all my pains and when i had really made a very good likeness of itmrs . weston and i were quite agreed in thinking it very likeonly too handsometoo flatteringbut that was a fault on the right sideafter all this came poor dear isabellas cold approbation ofyes it was a little likebut to be sure it did not do him justice . we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all . it was made a great favour of and altogether it was more than i could bear and so i never would finish it to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness to every morning visitor in brunswick squareand as i said i did then forswear ever drawing any body again . but for harriets sake or rather for my own and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present i will break my resolution now . mr .  elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea and was repeating no husbands and wives in the case at present indeed as you observe . exactly so . no husbands and wives with so interesting a consciousness that emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once . but as she wanted to be drawing the declaration must wait a little longer . she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait . it was to be a wholelength in watercolours like mr .  john knightleys and was destined if she could please herself to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece . the sitting began and harriet smiling and blushing and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist . but there was no doing any thing with mr .  elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch . she gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence but was really obliged to put an end to it and request him to place himself elsewhere . it then occurred to her to employ him in reading . if he would be so good as to read to them it would be a kindness indeed it would amuse away the difficulties of her part and lessen the irksomeness of miss smiths . mr .  elton was only too happy . harriet listened and emma drew in peace . she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil to jump up and see the progress and be charmed . there was no being displeased with such an encourager for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible . she could not respect his eye but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable . the sitting was altogether very satisfactory she was quite enough pleased with the first days sketch to wish to go on . there was no want of likeness she had been fortunate in the attitude and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure to give a little more height and considerably more elegance she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last and of its filling its destined place with credit to them botha standing memorial of the beauty of one the skill of the other and the friendship of both with as many other agreeable associations as mr .  eltons very promising attachment was likely to add . harriet was to sit again the next day and mr .  elton just as he ought entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again . by all means . we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party . the same civilities and courtesies the same success and satisfaction took place on the morrow and accompanied the whole progress of the picture which was rapid and happy . every body who saw it was pleased but mr .  elton was in continual raptures and defended it through every criticism . miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wantedobserved mrs .  weston to himnot in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover . the expression of the eye is most correct but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes . it is the fault of her face that she has them not . do you think so replied he . i cannot agree with you . it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature . i never saw such a likeness in my life . we must allow for the effect of shade you know . you have made her too tall emma said mr .  knightley . emma knew that she had but would not own it and mr .  elton warmly added oh no certainly not too tall not in the least too tall . consider she is sitting downwhich naturally presents a differentwhich in short gives exactly the ideaand the proportions must be preserved you know . proportions foreshortening . oh no it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smiths . exactly so indeed it is very pretty said mr .  woodhouse . so prettily done just as your drawings always are my dear . i do not know any body who draws so well as you do . the only thing i do not thoroughly like is that she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl over her shouldersand it makes one think she must catch cold . but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer . look at the tree . but it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear . you sir may say any thing cried mr .  elton but i must confess that i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss smith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit any other situation would have been much less in character . the naivete of miss smiths mannersand altogetheroh it is most admirable i cannot keep my eyes from it . i never saw such a likeness . the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed and here were a few difficulties . it must be done directly it must be done in london the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on and isabella the usual doer of all commissions must not be applied to because it was december and mr .  woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of december . but no sooner was the distress known to mr .  elton than it was removed . his gallantry was always on the alert . might he be trusted with the commission what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it he could ride to london at any time . it was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand . he was too goodshe could not endure the thoughtshe would not give him such a troublesome office for the worldbrought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurancesand a very few minutes settled the business . mr .  elton was to take the drawing to london chuse the frame and give the directions and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough . what a precious deposit said he with a tender sigh as he received it . this man is almost too gallant to be in love thought emma . i should say so but that i suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love . he is an excellent young man and will suit harriet exactly it will be an exactly so as he says himself but he does sigh and languish and study for compliments rather more than i could endure as a principal . i come in for a pretty good share as a second . but it is his gratitude on harriets account . chapter vii the very day of mr .  eltons going to london produced a fresh occasion for emmas services towards her friend . harriet had been at hartfield as usual soon after breakfast and after a time had gone home to return again to dinner she returned and sooner than had been talked of and with an agitated hurried look announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell . half a minute brought it all out . she had heard as soon as she got back to mrs .  goddards that mr .  martin had been there an hour before and finding she was not at home nor particularly expected had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters and gone away and on opening this parcel she had actually found besides the two songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy a letter to herself and this letter was from him from mr .  martin and contained a direct proposal of marriage . who could have thought it she was so surprized she did not know what to do . yes quite a proposal of marriage and a very good letter at least she thought so . and he wrote as if he really loved her very muchbut she did not knowand so she was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she should do . emma was halfashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful . upon my word she cried the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking . he will connect himself well if he can . will you read the letter cried harriet . pray do . id rather you would . emma was not sorry to be pressed . she read and was surprized . the style of the letter was much above her expectation . there were not merely no grammatical errors but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman the language though plain was strong and unaffected and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer . it was short but expressed good sense warm attachment liberality propriety even delicacy of feeling . she paused over it while harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion with a well well and was at last forced to add is it a good letter or is it too short yes indeed a very good letter replied emma rather slowlyso good a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of his sisters must have helped him . i can hardly imagine the young man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the style of a woman no certainly it is too strong and concise not diffuse enough for a woman . no doubt he is a sensible man and i suppose may have a natural talent forthinks strongly and clearlyand when he takes a pen in hand his thoughts naturally find proper words . it is so with some men . yes i understand the sort of mind . vigorous decided with sentiments to a certain point not coarse . a better written letter harriet returning it than i had expected . well said the still waiting harrietwellandand what shall i do what shall you do in what respect do you mean with regard to this letter yes . but what are you in doubt of you must answer it of courseand speedily . yes . but what shall i say dear miss woodhouse do advise me . oh no no the letter had much better be all your own . you will express yourself very properly i am sure . there is no danger of your not being intelligible which is the first thing . your meaning must be unequivocal no doubts or demurs and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires will present themselves unbidden to your mind i am persuaded . you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment . you think i ought to refuse him then said harriet looking down . ought to refuse him my dear harriet what do you mean are you in any doubt as to that i thoughtbut i beg your pardon perhaps i have been under a mistake . i certainly have been misunderstanding you if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer . i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it . harriet was silent . with a little reserve of manner emma continued you mean to return a favourable answer i collect . no i do not that is i do not meanwhat shall i do what would you advise me to do pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i ought to do . i shall not give you any advice harriet . i will have nothing to do with it . this is a point which you must settle with your feelings . i had no notion that he liked me so very much said harriet contemplating the letter . for a little while emma persevered in her silence but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful she thought it best to say i lay it down as a general rule harriet that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought to refuse him . if she can hesitate as to yes she ought to say no directly . it is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings with half a heart . i thought it my duty as a friend and older than yourself to say thus much to you . but do not imagine that i want to influence you . oh no i am sure you are a great deal too kind tobut if you would just advise me what i had best dono no i do not mean thatas you say ones mind ought to be quite made upone should not be hesitatingit is a very serious thing . it will be safer to say no perhaps . do you think i had better say no not for the world said emma smiling graciously would i advise you either way . you must be the best judge of your own happiness . if you prefer mr .  martin to every other person if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you hesitate you blush harriet . does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition harriet harriet do not deceive yourself do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion . at this moment whom are you thinking of the symptoms were favourable . instead of answering harriet turned away confused and stood thoughtfully by the fire and though the letter was still in her hand it was now mechanically twisted about without regard . emma waited the result with impatience but not without strong hopes . at last with some hesitation harriet said miss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must do as well as i can by myself and i have now quite determined and really almost made up my mindto refuse mr .  martin . do you think i am right perfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet you are doing just what you ought . while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation in approving . dear harriet i give myself joy of this . it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have been the consequence of your marrying mr .  martin . while you were in the smallest degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would not influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me . i could not have visited mrs .  robert martin of abbeymill farm . now i am secure of you for ever . harriet had not surmised her own danger but the idea of it struck her forcibly . you could not have visited me she cried looking aghast . no to be sure you could not but i never thought of that before . that would have been too dreadfulwhat an escapedear miss woodhouse i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world . indeed harriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you but it must have been . you would have thrown yourself out of all good society . i must have given you up . dear mehow should i ever have borne it it would have killed me never to come to hartfield any more dear affectionate creatureyou banished to abbeymill farmyou confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it . he must have a pretty good opinion of himself . i do not think he is conceited either in general said harriet her conscience opposing such censure at least he is very good natured and i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard forbut that is quite a different thing fromand you know though he may like me it does not follow that i shouldand certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen peopleand if one comes to compare them person and manners there is no comparison at all one is so very handsome and agreeable . however i do really think mr .  martin a very amiable young man and have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached to meand his writing such a letterbut as to leaving you it is what i would not do upon any consideration . thank you thank you my own sweet little friend . we will not be parted . a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked or because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter . oh noand it is but a short letter too . emma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass with a very true and it would be a small consolation to her for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day to know that her husband could write a good letter . oh yes very . nobody cares for a letter the thing is to be always happy with pleasant companions . i am quite determined to refuse him . but how shall i do what shall i say emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer and advised its being written directly which was agreed to in the hope of her assistance and though emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence . the looking over his letter again in replying to it had such a softening tendency that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment he would have been accepted after all . this letter however was written and sealed and sent . the business was finished and harriet safe . she was rather low all the evening but emma could allow for her amiable regrets and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection sometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr .  elton . i shall never be invited to abbeymill again was said in rather a sorrowful tone . nor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet . you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbeymill . and i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy but at hartfield . some time afterwards it was i think mrs .  goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened . i am sure miss nash wouldfor miss nash thinks her own sister very well married and it is only a linendraper . one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school harriet . i dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married . even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes . as to any thing superior for you i suppose she is quite in the dark . the attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittletattle of highbury yet . hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves . harriet blushed and smiled and said something about wondering that people should like her so much . the idea of mr .  elton was certainly cheering but still after a time she was tenderhearted again towards the rejected mr .  martin . now he has got my letter said she softly . i wonder what they are all doingwhether his sisters knowif he is unhappy they will be unhappy too . i hope he will not mind it so very much . let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed cried emma . at this moment perhaps mr .  elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much more beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five or six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name . my picturebut he has left my picture in bondstreet . has he sothen i know nothing of mr .  elton . no my dear little modest harriet depend upon it the picture will not be in bondstreet till just before he mounts his horse tomorrow . it is his companion all this evening his solace his delight . it opens his designs to his family it introduces you among them it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature eager curiosity and warm prepossession . how cheerful how animated how suspicious how busy their imaginations all are harriet smiled again and her smiles grew stronger . chapter viii harriet slept at hartfield that night . for some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there and gradually getting to have a bedroom appropriated to herself and emma judged it best in every respect safest and kindest to keep her with them as much as possible just at present . she was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs .  goddards but it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield to make a regular visit of some days . while she was gone mr .  knightley called and sat some time with mr .  woodhouse and emma till mr .  woodhouse who had previously made up his mind to walk out was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it and was induced by the entreaties of both though against the scruples of his own civility to leave mr .  knightley for that purpose . mr .  knightley who had nothing of ceremony about him was offering by his short decided answers an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other . well i believe if you will excuse me mr .  knightley if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing i shall take emmas advice and go out for a quarter of an hour . as the sun is out i believe i had better take my three turns while i can . i treat you without ceremony mr .  knightley . we invalids think we are privileged people . my dear sir do not make a stranger of me . i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter . emma will be happy to entertain you . and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turnsmy winter walk . you cannot do better sir . i would ask for the pleasure of your company mr .  knightley but i am a very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you and besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey . thank you sir thank you i am going this moment myself and i think the sooner you go the better . i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you . mr .  woodhouse at last was off but mr .  knightley instead of being immediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined for more chat . he began speaking of harriet and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before . i cannot rate her beauty as you do said he but she is a pretty little creature and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition . her character depends upon those she is with but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman . i am glad you think so and the good hands i hope may not be wanting . come said he you are anxious for a compliment so i will tell you that you have improved her . you have cured her of her schoolgirls giggle she really does you credit . thank you . i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i had been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may . you do not often overpower me with it . you are expecting her again you say this morning almost every moment . she has been gone longer already than she intended . something has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps . highbury gossipstiresome wretches harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would . emma knew this was too true for contradiction and therefore said nothing . he presently added with a smile i do not pretend to fix on times or places but i must tell you that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage . indeed how so of what sort a very serious sort i assure you still smiling . very serious i can think of but one thingwho is in love with her who makes you their confidant emma was more than half in hopes of mr .  eltons having dropt a hint . mr .  knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser and she knew mr .  elton looked up to him . i have reason to think he replied that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable quarterrobert martin is the man . her visit to abbeymill this summer seems to have done his business . he is desperately in love and means to marry her . he is very obliging said emma but is he sure that harriet means to marry him well well means to make her an offer then . will that do he came to the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it . he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and i believe considers me as one of his best friends . he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early whether i thought her too young in short whether i approved his choice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered especially since your making so much of her as in a line of society above him . i was very much pleased with all that he said . i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin . he always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very well judging . he told me every thing his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage . he is an excellent young man both as son and brother . i had no hesitation in advising him to marry . he proved to me that he could afford it and that being the case i was convinced he could not do better . i praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy . if he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought highly of me then and i dare say left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had . this happened the night before last . now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs .  goddards today and she may be detained by a visitor without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch . pray mr .  knightley said emma who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech how do you know that mr .  martin did not speak yesterday certainly replied he surprized i do not absolutely know it but it may be inferred . was not she the whole day with you come said she i will tell you something in return for what you have told me . he did speak yesterdaythat is he wrote and was refused . this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed and mr .  knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure as he stood up in tall indignation and said then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her . what is the foolish girl about oh to be sure cried emma it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage . a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her . nonsense a man does not imagine any such thing . but what is the meaning of this harriet smith refuse robert martin madness if it is so but i hope you are mistaken . i saw her answernothing could be clearer . you saw her answeryou wrote her answer too . emma this is your doing . you persuaded her to refuse him . and if i did which however i am far from allowing i should not feel that i had done wrong . mr .  martin is a very respectable young man but i cannot admit him to be harriets equal and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her . by your account he does seem to have had some scruples . it is a pity that they were ever got over . not harriets equal exclaimed mr .  knightley loudly and warmly and with calmer asperity added a few moments afterwards no he is not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation . emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you . what are harriet smiths claims either of birth nature or education to any connexion higher than robert martin she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision at all and certainly no respectable relations . she is known only as parlourboarder at a common school . she is not a sensible girl nor a girl of any information . she has been taught nothing useful and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself . at her age she can have no experience and with her little wit is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her . she is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all . my only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being beneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him . i felt that as to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse . but i could not reason so to a man in love and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort of disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led aright and turn out very well . the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have i now that there would be a general cryout upon her extreme good luck . even your satisfaction i made sure of . it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friends leaving highbury for the sake of her being settled so well . i remember saying to myself even emma with all her partiality for harriet will think this a good match . i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing . what think a farmer and with all his sense and all his merit mr .  martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate friend not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own i wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings . i assure you mine are very different . i must think your statement by no means fair . you are not just to harriets claims . they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself mr .  martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society . the sphere in which she moves is much above his . it would be a degradation . a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a respectable intelligent gentlemanfarmer as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense . she is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up . there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentlemanand a gentleman of fortune . her allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort . that she is a gentlemans daughter is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemens daughters no one i apprehend will deny . she is superior to mr .  robert martin . whoever might be her parents said mr .  knightley whoever may have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society . after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs .  goddards hands to shift as she canto move in short in mrs .  goddards line to have mrs .  goddards acquaintance . her friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it was good enough . she desired nothing better herself . till you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it . she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer . she had no sense of superiority then . if she has it now you have given it . you have been no friend to harriet smith emma . robert martin would never have proceeded so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him . i know him well . he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion . and as to conceit he is the farthest from it of any man i know . depend upon it he had encouragement . it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again . you are a very warm friend to mr .  martin but as i said before are unjust to harriet . harriets claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them . she is not a clever girl but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly . waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and goodnatured let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninetynine people out of an hundred and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall in love with wellinformed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a claim to be nice . her goodnature too is not so very slight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great readiness to be pleased with other people . i am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claims a woman could possess . upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so too . better be without sense than misapply it as you do . to be sure cried she playfully . i know that is the feeling of you all . i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights inwhat at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment . oh harriet may pick and chuse . were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you . and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives nopray let her have time to look about her . i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy said mr .  knightley presently though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet . you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her . vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief . nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high . miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl . men of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives . men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurityand most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed . let her marry robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune she may be a parlourboarder at mrs .  goddards all the rest of her lifeor at least for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the old writingmasters son . we think so very differently on this point mr .  knightley that there can be no use in canvassing it . we shall only be making each other more angry . but as to my letting her marry robert martin it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think as must prevent any second application . she must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do . his appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now . i can imagine that before she had seen any body superior she might tolerate him . he was the brother of her friends and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not while she was at abbeymill find him disagreeable . but the case is altered now . she knows now what gentlemen are and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet . nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked cried mr .  knightley . robert martins manners have sense sincerity and goodhumour to recommend them and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand . emma made no answer and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone . she did not repent what she had done she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general which made her dislike having it so loudly against her and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state was very disagreeable . some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence with only one attempt on emmas side to talk of the weather but he made no answer . he was thinking . the result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words . robert martin has no great lossif he can but think so and i hope it will not be long before he does . your views for harriet are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love of matchmaking it is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you haveand as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain . emma laughed and disclaimed . he continued depend upon it elton will not do . elton is a very good sort of man and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match . he knows the value of a good income as well as any body . elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally . he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with harriets . he knows that he is a very handsome young man and a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away . i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece . i am very much obliged to you said emma laughing again . if i had set my heart on mr .  eltons marrying harriet it would have been very kind to open my eyes but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself . i have done with matchmaking indeed . i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls . i shall leave off while i am well . good morning to yousaid he rising and walking off abruptly . he was very much vexed . he felt the disappointment of the young man and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it by the sanction he had given and the part which he was persuaded emma had taken in the affair was provoking him exceedingly . emma remained in a state of vexation too but there was more indistinctness in the causes of hers than in his . she did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversarys wrong as mr .  knightley . he walked off in more complete selfapprobation than he left for her . she was not so materially cast down however but that a little time and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives . harriets staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy . the possibility of the young mans coming to mrs .  goddards that morning and meeting with harriet and pleading his own cause gave alarming ideas . the dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness and when harriet appeared and in very good spirits and without having any such reason to give for her long absence she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind and convinced her that let mr .  knightley think or say what he would she had done nothing which womans friendship and womans feelings would not justify . he had frightened her a little about mr .  elton but when she considered that mr .  knightley could not have observed him as she had done neither with the interest nor she must be allowed to tell herself in spite of mr .  knightleys pretensions with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself that he had spoken it hastily and in anger she was able to believe that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true than what he knew any thing about . he certainly might have heard mr .  elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done and mr .  elton might not be of an imprudent inconsiderate disposition as to money matters he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them but then mr .  knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives . mr .  knightley saw no such passion and of course thought nothing of its effects but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest and more than a reasonable becoming degree of prudence she was very sure did not belong to mr .  elton . harriets cheerful look and manner established hers she came back not to think of mr .  martin but to talk of mr .  elton . miss nash had been telling her something which she repeated immediately with great delight . mr .  perry had been to mrs .  goddards to attend a sick child and miss nash had seen him and he had told miss nash that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park he had met mr .  elton and found to his great surprize that mr .  elton was actually on his road to london and not meaning to return till the morrow though it was the whistclub night which he had been never known to miss before and mr .  perry had remonstrated with him about it and told him how shabby it was in him their best player to absent himself and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day but it would not do mr .  elton had been determined to go on and had said in a very particular way indeed that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world and something about a very enviable commission and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious . mr .  perry could not quite understand him but he was very sure there must be a lady in the case and he told him so and mr .  elton only looked very conscious and smiling and rode off in great spirits . miss nash had told her all this and had talked a great deal more about mr .  elton and said looking so very significantly at her that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be but she only knew that any woman whom mr .  elton could prefer she should think the luckiest woman in the world for beyond a doubt mr .  elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness . chapter ix mr .  knightley might quarrel with her but emma could not quarrel with herself . he was so much displeased that it was longer than usual before he came to hartfield again and when they did meet his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven . she was sorry but could not repent . on the contrary her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days . the picture elegantly framed came safely to hand soon after mr .  eltons return and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sittingroom he got up to look at it and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought and as for harriets feelings they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted . emma was soon perfectly satisfied of mr .  martins being no otherwise remembered than as he furnished a contrast with mr .  elton of the utmost advantage to the latter . her views of improving her little friends mind by a great deal of useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more than a few first chapters and the intention of going on tomorrow . it was much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at harriets fortune than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts and the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with into a thin quarto of hotpressed paper made up by her friend and ornamented with ciphers and trophies . in this age of literature such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon . miss nash headteacher at mrs .  goddards had written out at least three hundred and harriet who had taken the first hint of it from her hoped with miss woodhouses help to get a great many more . emma assisted with her invention memory and taste and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order in form as well as quantity . mr .  woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in . so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was younghe wondered he could not remember them but he hoped he should in time . and it always ended in kitty a fair but frozen maid . his good friend perry too whom he had spoken to on the subject did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind but he had desired perry to be upon the watch and as he went about so much something he thought might come from that quarter . it was by no means his daughters wish that the intellects of highbury in general should be put under requisition . mr .  elton was the only one whose assistance she asked . he was invited to contribute any really good enigmas charades or conundrums that he might recollect and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections and at the same time as she could perceive most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips . they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled and rather sentimentally recited that wellknown charade my first doth affliction denote which my second is destind to feel and my whole is the best antidote that affliction to soften and heal . made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already . why will not you write one yourself for us mr .  elton said she that is the only security for its freshness and nothing could be easier to you . oh no he had never written hardly ever any thing of the kind in his life . the stupidest fellow he was afraid not even miss woodhousehe stopt a momentor miss smith could inspire him . the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration . he called for a few moments just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing as he said a charade which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady the object of his admiration but which from his manner emma was immediately convinced must be his own . i do not offer it for miss smiths collection said he . being my friends i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it . the speech was more to emma than to harriet which emma could understand . there was deep consciousness about him and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friends . he was gone the next momentafter another moments pause take it said emma smiling and pushing the paper towards harrietit is for you . take your own . but harriet was in a tremor and could not touch it and emma never loth to be first was obliged to examine it herself . to miss charade . my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings lords of the earth their luxury and ease . another view of man my second brings behold him there the monarch of the seas but ah united what reverse we have mans boasted power and freedom all are flown lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave and woman lovely woman reigns alone . thy ready wit the word will soon supply may its approval beam in that soft eye she cast her eye over it pondered caught the meaning read it through again to be quite certain and quite mistress of the lines and then passing it to harriet sat happily smiling and saying to herself while harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness very well mr .  elton very well indeed . i have read worse charades . courtshipa very good hint . i give you credit for it . this is feeling your way . this is saying very plainlypray miss smith give me leave to pay my addresses to you . approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance . may its approval beam in that soft eye harriet exactly . soft is the very word for her eyeof all epithets the justest that could be given . thy ready wit the word will soon supply . humphharriets ready wit all the better . a man must be very much in love indeed to describe her so . ah mr .  knightley i wish you had the benefit of this i think this would convince you . for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken . an excellent charade indeed and very much to the purpose . things must come to a crisis soon now . she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length by the eagerness of harriets wondering questions . what can it be miss woodhousewhat can it be i have not an ideai cannot guess it in the least . what can it possibly be do try to find it out miss woodhouse . do help me . i never saw any thing so hard . is it kingdom i wonder who the friend wasand who could be the young lady . do you think it is a good one can it be woman and woman lovely woman reigns alone . can it be neptune behold him there the monarch of the seas or a trident or a mermaid or a shark oh no shark is only one syllable . it must be very clever or he would not have brought it . oh miss woodhouse do you think we shall ever find it out mermaids and sharks nonsense my dear harriet what are you thinking of where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark give me the paper and listen . for miss  read miss smith . my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings lords of the earth their luxury and ease . that is court . another view of man my second brings behold him there the monarch of the seas that is shipplain as it can be . now for the cream . but ah united courtship you know what reverse we have mans boasted power and freedom all are flown . lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave and woman lovely woman reigns alone . a very proper complimentand then follows the application which i think my dear harriet you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending . read it in comfort to yourself . there can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you . harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion . she read the concluding lines and was all flutter and happiness . she could not speak . but she was not wanted to speak . it was enough for her to feel . emma spoke for her . there is so pointed and so particular a meaning in this compliment said she that i cannot have a doubt as to mr .  eltons intentions . you are his objectand you will soon receive the completest proof of it . i thought it must be so . i thought i could not be so deceived but now it is clear the state of his mind is as clear and decided as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you . yes harriet just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened . i could never tell whether an attachment between you and mr .  elton were most desirable or most natural . its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other i am very happy . i congratulate you my dear harriet with all my heart . this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating . this is a connexion which offers nothing but good . it will give you every thing that you wantconsideration independence a proper homeit will fix you in the centre of all your real friends close to hartfield and to me and confirm our intimacy for ever . this harriet is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us . dear miss woodhouseand dear miss woodhouse was all that harriet with many tender embraces could articulate at first but when they did arrive at something more like conversation it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw felt anticipated and remembered just as she ought . mr .  eltons superiority had very ample acknowledgment . whatever you say is always right cried harriet and therefore i suppose and believe and hope it must be so but otherwise i could not have imagined it . it is so much beyond any thing i deserve . mr .  elton who might marry any body there cannot be two opinions about him . he is so very superior . only think of those sweet versesto miss  . dear me how clevercould it really be meant for me i cannot make a question or listen to a question about that . it is a certainty . receive it on my judgment . it is a sort of prologue to the play a motto to the chapter and will be soon followed by matteroffact prose . it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected . i am sure a month ago i had no more idea myselfthe strangest things do take place when miss smiths and mr .  eltons get acquaintedthey do indeedand really it is strange it is out of the common course that what is so evidently so palpably desirablewhat courts the prearrangement of other people should so immediately shape itself into the proper form . you and mr .  elton are by situation called together you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes . your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls . there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow . the course of true love never did run smooth a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage . that mr .  elton should really be in love with meme of all people who did not know him to speak to him at michaelmas and he the very handsomest man that ever was and a man that every body looks up to quite like mr .  knightley his company so sought after that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it that he has more invitations than there are days in the week . and so excellent in the church miss nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury . dear me when i look back to the first time i saw him how little did i thinkthe two abbots and i ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and miss nash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself however she called me back presently and let me look too which was very goodnatured . and how beautiful we thought he looked he was arminarm with mr .  cole . this is an alliance which whoeverwhatever your friends may be must be agreeable to them provided at least they have common sense and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools . if they are anxious to see you happily married here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of itif they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in here it will be accomplished and if their only object is that you should in the common phrase be well married here is the comfortable fortune the respectable establishment the rise in the world which must satisfy them . yes very true . how nicely you talk i love to hear you . you understand every thing . you and mr .  elton are one as clever as the other . this charadeif i had studied a twelvemonth i could never have made any thing like it . i thought he meant to try his skill by his manner of declining it yesterday . i do think it is without exception the best charade i ever read . i never read one more to the purpose certainly . it is as long again as almost all we have had before . i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour . such things in general cannot be too short . harriet was too intent on the lines to hear . the most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind . it is one thing said she presentlyher cheeks in a glowto have very good sense in a common way like every body else and if there is any thing to say to sit down and write a letter and say just what you must in a short way and another to write verses and charades like this . emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of mr .  martins prose . such sweet lines continued harrietthese two lastbut how shall i ever be able to return the paper or say i have found it outoh miss woodhouse what can we do about that leave it to me . you do nothing . he will be here this evening i dare say and then i will give it him back and some nonsense or other will pass between us and you shall not be committed . your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming . trust to me . oh miss woodhouse what a pity that i must not write this beautiful charade into my book i am sure i have not got one half so good . leave out the two last lines and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book . oh but those two lines are the best of all . grantedfor private enjoyment and for private enjoyment keep them . they are not at all the less written you know because you divide them . the couplet does not cease to be nor does its meaning change . but take it away and all appropriation ceases and a very pretty gallant charade remains fit for any collection . depend upon it he would not like to have his charade slighted much better than his passion . a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities or neither . give me the book i will write it down and then there can be no possible reflection on you . harriet submitted though her mind could hardly separate the parts so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love . it seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity . i shall never let that book go out of my own hands said she . very well replied emma a most natural feeling and the longer it lasts the better i shall be pleased . but here is my father coming you will not object to my reading the charade to him . it will be giving him so much pleasure he loves any thing of the sort and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment . he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us allyou must let me read it to him . harriet looked grave . my dear harriet you must not refine too much upon this charade . you will betray your feelings improperly if you are too conscious and too quick and appear to affix more meaning or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it . do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration . if he had been anxious for secrecy he would not have left the paper while i was by but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you . do not let us be too solemn on the business . he has encouragement enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over this charade . oh noi hope i shall not be ridiculous about it . do as you please . mr .  woodhouse came in and very soon led to the subject again by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of well my dears how does your book go onhave you got any thing fresh yes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh . a piece of paper was found on the table this morningdropt we suppose by a fairycontaining a very pretty charade and we have just copied it in . she read it to him just as he liked to have any thing read slowly and distinctly and two or three times over with explanations of every part as she proceededand he was very much pleased and as she had foreseen especially struck with the complimentary conclusion . aye thats very just indeed thats very properly said . very true . woman lovely woman . it is such a pretty charade my dear that i can easily guess what fairy brought it . nobody could have written so prettily but you emma . emma only nodded and smiled . after a little thinking and a very tender sigh he added ah it is no difficulty to see who you take after your dear mother was so clever at all those things if i had but her memory but i can remember nothingnot even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention i can only recollect the first stanza and there are several . kitty a fair but frozen maid kindled a flame i yet deplore the hoodwinkd boy i called to aid though of his near approach afraid so fatal to my suit before . and that is all that i can recollect of itbut it is very clever all the way through . but i think my dear you said you had got it . yes papa it is written out in our second page . we copied it from the elegant extracts . it was garricks you know . aye very true . i wish i could recollect more of it . kitty a fair but frozen maid . the name makes me think of poor isabella for she was very near being christened catherine after her grandmama . i hope we shall have her here next week . have you thought my dear where you shall put herand what room there will be for the children oh yesshe will have her own room of course the room she always hasand there is the nursery for the childrenjust as usual you know . why should there be any change i do not know my dearbut it is so long since she was herenot since last easter and then only for a few days . mr . john knightleys being a lawyer is very inconvenient . poor isabellashe is sadly taken away from us alland how sorry she will be when she comes not to see miss taylor here she will not be surprized papa at least . i do not know my dear . i am sure i was very much surprized when i first heard she was going to be married . we must ask mr .  and mrs .  weston to dine with us while isabella is here . yes my dear if there is time . butin a very depressed toneshe is coming for only one week . there will not be time for any thing . it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longerbut it seems a case of necessity . mr .  john knightley must be in town again on the 28th and we ought to be thankful papa that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country that two or three days are not to be taken out for the abbey . mr .  knightley promises to give up his claim this christmasthough you know it is longer since they were with him than with us . it would be very hard indeed my dear if poor isabella were to be anywhere but at hartfield . mr .  woodhouse could never allow for mr .  knightleys claims on his brother or any bodys claims on isabella except his own . he sat musing a little while and then said but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so soon though he does . i think emma i shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us . she and the children might stay very well . ah papathat is what you never have been able to accomplish and i do not think you ever will . isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband . this was too true for contradiction . unwelcome as it was mr .  woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh and as emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughters attachment to her husband she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them . harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here . i am sure she will be pleased with the children . we are very proud of the children are not we papa i wonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john aye i wonder which she will . poor little dears how glad they will be to come . they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet . i dare say they are sir . i am sure i do not know who is not . henry is a fine boy but john is very like his mama . henry is the eldest he was named after me not after his father . john the second is named after his father . some people are surprized i believe that the eldest was not but isabella would have him called henry which i thought very pretty of her . and he is a very clever boy indeed . they are all remarkably clever and they have so many pretty ways . they will come and stand by my chair and say grandpapa can you give me a bit of string and once henry asked me for a knife but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas . i think their father is too rough with them very often . he appears rough to you said emma because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough . he wishes his boys to be active and hardy and if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then but he is an affectionate fathercertainly mr .  john knightley is an affectionate father . the children are all fond of him . and then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way but they like it papa there is nothing they like so much . it is such enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns whichever began would never give way to the other . well i cannot understand it . that is the case with us all papa . one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other . later in the morning and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four oclock dinner the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again . harriet turned away but emma could receive him with the usual smile and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a pushof having thrown a die and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up . his ostensible reason however was to ask whether mr .  woodhouses party could be made up in the evening without him or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield . if he were every thing else must give way but otherwise his friend cole had been saying so much about his dining with himhad made such a point of it that he had promised him conditionally to come . emma thanked him but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account her father was sure of his rubber . he reurgedshe redeclined and he seemed then about to make his bow when taking the paper from the table she returned it oh here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us thank you for the sight of it . we admired it so much that i have ventured to write it into miss smiths collection . your friend will not take it amiss i hope . of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines . mr .  elton certainly did not very well know what to say . he looked rather doubtinglyrather confused said something about honourglanced at emma and at harriet and then seeing the book open on the table took it up and examined it very attentively . with the view of passing off an awkward moment emma smilingly said you must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two . he may be sure of every womans approbation while he writes with such gallantry . i have no hesitation in saying replied mr .  elton though hesitating a good deal while he spoke i have no hesitation in sayingat least if my friend feels at all as i doi have not the smallest doubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as i see it looking at the book again and replacing it on the table he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life . after this speech he was gone as soon as possible . emma could not think it too soon for with all his good and agreeable qualities there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh . she ran away to indulge the inclination leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriets share . chapter x though now the middle of december there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise and on the morrow emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family who lived a little way out of highbury . their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane a lane leading at right angles from the broad though irregular main street of the place and as may be inferred containing the blessed abode of mr .  elton . a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed and then about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage an old and not very good house almost as close to the road as it could be . it had no advantage of situation but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor and such as it was there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes . emmas remark was there it is . there go you and your riddlebook one of these days . harriets was oh what a sweet househow very beautifulthere are the yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much . i do not often walk this way now said emma as they proceeded but then there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards of this part of highbury . harriet she found had never in her life been within side the vicarage and her curiosity to see it was so extreme that considering exteriors and probabilities emma could only class it as a proof of love with mr .  eltons seeing ready wit in her . i wish we could contrive it said she but i cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going inno servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeperno message from my father . she pondered but could think of nothing . after a mutual silence of some minutes harriet thus began again i do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married or going to be married so charming as you are emma laughed and replied my being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry i must find other people charmingone other person at least . and i am not only not going to be married at present but have very little intention of ever marrying at all . ahso you say but i cannot believe it . i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet to be tempted mr .  elton you know recollecting herself is out of the question and i do not wish to see any such person . i would rather not be tempted . i cannot really change for the better . if i were to marry i must expect to repent it . dear meit is so odd to hear a woman talk so i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry . were i to fall in love indeed it would be a different thing but i never have been in love it is not my way or my nature and i do not think i ever shall . and without love i am sure i should be a fool to change such a situation as mine . fortune i do not want employment i do not want consequence i do not want i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husbands house as i am of hartfield and never never could i expect to be so truly beloved and important so always first and always right in any mans eyes as i am in my fathers . but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates that is as formidable an image as you could present harriet and if i thought i should ever be like miss bates so sillyso satisfied so smilingso prosingso undistinguishing and unfastidious and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me i would marry tomorrow . but between us i am convinced there never can be any likeness except in being unmarried . but still you will be an old maid and thats so dreadful never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public a single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous disagreeable old maid the proper sport of boys and girls but a single woman of good fortune is always respectable and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else . and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper . those who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small and generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross . this does not apply however to miss bates she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very much to the taste of every body though single and though poor . poverty certainly has not contracted her mind i really believe if she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that is a great charm . dear me but what shall you do how shall you employ yourself when you grow old if i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great many independent resources and i do not perceive why i should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than oneandtwenty . womans usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now or with no important variation . if i draw less i shall read more if i give up music i shall take to carpetwork . and as for objects of interest objects for the affections which is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying i shall be very well off with all the children of a sister i love so much to care about . there will be enough of them in all probability to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need . there will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder . my nephews and niecesi shall often have a niece with me . do you know miss batess niece that is i know you must have seen her a hundred timesbut are you acquainted oh yes we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to highbury . by the bye that is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece . heaven forbid at least that i should ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together as she does about jane fairfax . one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax . every letter from her is read forty times over her compliments to all friends go round and round again and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother one hears of nothing else for a month . i wish jane fairfax very well but she tires me to death . they were now approaching the cottage and all idle topics were superseded . emma was very compassionate and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness her counsel and her patience as from her purse . she understood their ways could allow for their ignorance and their temptations had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little entered into their troubles with ready sympathy and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as goodwill . in the present instance it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to harriet as they walked away these are the sights harriet to do one good . how trifling they make every thing else appeari feel now as if i could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day and yet who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind very true said harriet . poor creatures one can think of nothing else . and really i do not think the impression will soon be over said emma as she crossed the low hedge and tottering footstep which ended the narrow slippery path through the cottage garden and brought them into the lane again . i do not think it will stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place and recall the still greater within . oh dear no said her companion . they walked on . the lane made a slight bend and when that bend was passed mr .  elton was immediately in sight and so near as to give emma time only to say farther ah harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts . well smiling i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers it has done all that is truly important . if we feel for the wretched enough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy only distressing to ourselves . harriet could just answer oh dear yes before the gentleman joined them . the wants and sufferings of the poor family however were the first subject on meeting . he had been going to call on them . his visit he would now defer but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done . mr .  elton then turned back to accompany them . to fall in with each other on such an errand as this thought emma to meet in a charitable scheme this will bring a great increase of love on each side . i should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration . it must if i were not here . i wish i were anywhere else . anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath a little raised on one side of the lane leaving them together in the main road . but she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriets habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too and that in short they would both be soon after her . this would not do she immediately stopped under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her halfboot and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath begged them to have the goodness to walk on and she would follow in half a minute . they did as they were desired and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot she had the comfort of farther delay in her power being overtaken by a child from the cottage setting out according to orders with her pitcher to fetch broth from hartfield . to walk by the side of this child and talk to and question her was the most natural thing in the world or would have been the most natural had she been acting just then without design and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead without any obligation of waiting for her . she gained on them however involuntarily the childs pace was quick and theirs rather slow and she was the more concerned at it from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them . mr .  elton was speaking with animation harriet listening with a very pleased attention and emma having sent the child on was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more when they both looked around and she was obliged to join them . mr .  elton was still talking still engaged in some interesting detail and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterdays party at his friend coles and that she was come in herself for the stilton cheese the north wiltshire the butter the cellery the beetroot and all the dessert . this would soon have led to something better of course was her consoling reflection any thing interests between those who love and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart . if i could but have kept longer away they now walked on together quietly till within view of the vicarage pales when a sudden resolution of at least getting harriet into the house made her again find something very much amiss about her boot and fall behind to arrange it once more . she then broke the lace off short and dexterously throwing it into a ditch was presently obliged to entreat them to stop and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort . part of my lace is gone said she and i do not know how i am to contrive . i really am a most troublesome companion to you both but i hope i am not often so illequipped . mr .  elton i must beg leave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on . mr .  elton looked all happiness at this proposition and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage . the room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied and looking forwards behind it was another with which it immediately communicated the door between them was open and emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner . she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it but she fully intended that mr .  elton should close it . it was not closed however it still remained ajar but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room . for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself . it could be protracted no longer . she was then obliged to be finished and make her appearance . the lovers were standing together at one of the windows . it had a most favourable aspect and for half a minute emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully . but it would not do he had not come to the point . he had been most agreeable most delightful he had told harriet that he had seen them go by and had purposely followed them other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt but nothing serious . cautious very cautious thought emma he advances inch by inch and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure . still however though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both and must be leading them forward to the great event . chapter xi mr .  elton must now be left to himself . it was no longer in emmas power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures . the coming of her sisters family was so very near at hand that first in anticipation and then in reality it became henceforth her prime object of interest and during the ten days of their stay at hartfield it was not to be expectedshe did not herself expect that any thing beyond occasional fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers . they might advance rapidly if they would however they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no . she hardly wished to have more leisure for them . there are people who the more you do for them the less they will do for themselves . mr .  and mrs .  john knightley from having been longer than usual absent from surry were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest . till this year every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to seabathing for the children and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their surry connexions or seen at all by mr .  woodhouse who could not be induced to get so far as london even for poor isabellas sake and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit . he thought much of the evils of the journey for her and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way but his alarms were needless the sixteen miles being happily accomplished and mr .  and mrs .  john knightley their five children and a competent number of nurserymaids all reaching hartfield in safety . the bustle and joy of such an arrival the many to be talked to welcomed encouraged and variously dispersed and disposed of produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause nor have endured much longer even for this but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by mrs .  john knightley that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance all the eating and drinking and sleeping and playing which they could possibly wish for without the smallest delay the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them . mrs .  john knightley was a pretty elegant little woman of gentle quiet manners and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate wrapt up in her family a devoted wife a doating mother and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that but for these higher ties a warmer love might have seemed impossible . she could never see a fault in any of them . she was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness and with this resemblance of her father she inherited also much of his constitution was delicate in her own health overcareful of that of her children had many fears and many nerves and was as fond of her own mr .  wingfield in town as her father could be of mr .  perry . they were alike too in a general benevolence of temper and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance . mr .  john knightley was a tall gentlemanlike and very clever man rising in his profession domestic and respectable in his private character but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing and capable of being sometimes out of humour . he was not an illtempered man not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach but his temper was not his great perfection and indeed with such a worshipping wife it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased . the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his . he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted and he could sometimes act an ungracious or say a severe thing . he was not a great favourite with his fair sisterinlaw . nothing wrong in him escaped her . she was quick in feeling the little injuries to isabella which isabella never felt herself . perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to isabellas sister but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend without praise and without blindness but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into the want of respectful forbearance towards her father . there he had not always the patience that could have been wished . mr .  woodhouses peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally illbestowed . it did not often happen for mr .  john knightley had really a great regard for his fatherinlaw and generally a strong sense of what was due to him but it was too often for emmas charity especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured though the offence came not . the beginning however of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality . they had not been long seated and composed when mr .  woodhouse with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh called his daughters attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last . ah my dear said he poor miss taylorit is a grievous business . oh yes sir cried she with ready sympathy how you must miss her and dear emma toowhat a dreadful loss to you both i have been so grieved for you . i could not imagine how you could possibly do without her . it is a sad change indeed . but i hope she is pretty well sir . pretty well my deari hopepretty well . i do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably . mr .  john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of randalls . oh nonone in the least . i never saw mrs .  weston better in my life never looking so well . papa is only speaking his own regret . very much to the honour of both was the handsome reply . and do you see her sir tolerably often asked isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father . mr .  woodhouse hesitated . not near so often my dear as i could wish . oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married . either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr .  weston or mrs .  weston and generally both either at randalls or hereand as you may suppose isabella most frequently here . they are very very kind in their visits . mr .  weston is really as kind as herself . papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all . every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr .  and mrs .  weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipatedwhich is the exact truth . just as it should be said mr .  john knightley and just as i hoped it was from your letters . her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy . i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emmas account i hope you will be satisfied . why to be sure said mr .  woodhouseyes certainlyi cannot deny that mrs .  weston poor mrs .  weston does come and see us pretty often but thenshe is always obliged to go away again . it would be very hard upon mr .  weston if she did not papa . you quite forget poor mr .  weston . i think indeed said john knightley pleasantly that mr .  weston has some little claim . you and i emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband . i being a husband and you not being a wife the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force . as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr .  westons aside as much as she can . me my love cried his wife hearing and understanding only in part . are you talking about mei am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr .  weston that excellent mr .  weston i think there is nothing he does not deserve . i believe he is one of the very besttempered men that ever existed . excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal for temper . i shall never forget his flying henrys kite for him that very windy day last easterand ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve oclock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence . if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor . where is the young man said john knightley . has he been here on this occasionor has he not he has not been here yet replied emma . there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended in nothing and i have not heard him mentioned lately . but you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father . he wrote a letter to poor mrs .  weston to congratulate her and a very proper handsome letter it was . she shewed it to me . i thought it very well done of him indeed . whether it was his own idea you know one cannot tell . he is but young and his uncle perhaps my dear papa he is threeandtwenty . you forget how time passes . threeandtwentyis he indeedwell i could not have thought it and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother well time does fly indeedand my memory is very bad . however it was an exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr .  and mrs .  weston a great deal of pleasure . i remember it was written from weymouth and dated sept .  28thand began my dear madam but i forget how it went on and it was signed f .  c .  weston churchill . i remember that perfectly . how very pleasing and proper of him cried the goodhearted mrs .  john knightley . i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man . but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father there is something so shocking in a childs being taken away from his parents and natural home i never could comprehend how mr .  weston could part with him . to give up ones child i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else . nobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy observed mr .  john knightley coolly . but you need not imagine mr .  weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john . mr .  weston is rather an easy cheerfultempered man than a man of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other depending i suspect much more upon what is called society for his comforts that is upon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any thing that home affords . emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr .  weston and had half a mind to take it up but she struggled and let it pass . she would keep the peace if possible and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits the allsufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brothers disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse and those to whom it was important . it had a high claim to forbearance . chapter xii mr .  knightley was to dine with themrather against the inclination of mr .  woodhouse who did not like that any one should share with him in isabellas first day . emmas sense of right however had decided it and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother she had particular pleasure from the circumstance of the late disagreement between mr .  knightley and herself in procuring him the proper invitation . she hoped they might now become friends again . she thought it was time to make up . makingup indeed would not do . she certainly had not been in the wrong and he would never own that he had . concession must be out of the question but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship that when he came into the room she had one of the children with herthe youngest a nice little girl about eight months old who was now making her first visit to hartfield and very happy to be danced about in her aunts arms . it did assist for though he began with grave looks and short questions he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity . emma felt they were friends again and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction and then a little sauciness she could not help saying as he was admiring the baby what a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces . as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different but with regard to these children i observe we never disagree . if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them as you are where these children are concerned we might always think alike . to be sureour discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong . yes said he smilingand reason good . i was sixteen years old when you were born . a material difference then she repliedand no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives but does not the lapse of oneandtwenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer yesa good deal nearer . but still not near enough to give me a chance of being right if we think differently . i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child . come my dear emma let us be friends and say no more about it . tell your aunt little emma that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now . thats true she criedvery true . little emma grow up a better woman than your aunt . be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited . now mr .  knightley a word or two more and i have done . as far as good intentions went we were both right and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong . i only want to know that mr .  martin is not very very bitterly disappointed . a man cannot be more so was his short full answer . ahindeed i am very sorry . come shake hands with me . this had just taken place and with great cordiality when john knightley made his appearance and how dye do george and john how are you succeeded in the true english style burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference the real attachment which would have led either of them if requisite to do every thing for the good of the other . the evening was quiet and conversable as mr .  woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear isabella and the little party made two natural divisions on one side he and his daughter on the other the two mr .  knightleys their subjects totally distinct or very rarely mixingand emma only occasionally joining in one or the other . the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits but principally of those of the elder whose temper was by much the most communicative and who was always the greater talker . as a magistrate he had generally some point of law to consult john about or at least some curious anecdote to give and as a farmer as keeping in hand the homefarm at donwell he had to tell what every field was to bear next year and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life and whose attachments were strong . the plan of a drain the change of a fence the felling of a tree and the destination of every acre for wheat turnips or spring corn was entered into with as much equality of interest by john as his cooler manners rendered possible and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness . while they were thus comfortably occupied mr .  woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter . my poor dear isabella said he fondly taking her hand and interrupting for a few moments her busy labours for some one of her five childrenhow long it is how terribly long since you were here and how tired you must be after your journey you must go to bed early my dearand i recommend a little gruel to you before you go . you and i will have a nice basin of gruel together . my dear emma suppose we all have a little gruel . emma could not suppose any such thing knowing as she did that both the mr .  knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herselfand two basins only were ordered . after a little more discourse in praise of gruel with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body he proceeded to say with an air of grave reflection it was an awkward business my dear your spending the autumn at south end instead of coming here . i never had much opinion of the sea air . mr .  wingfield most strenuously recommended it siror we should not have gone . he recommended it for all the children but particularly for the weakness in little bellas throat both sea air and bathing . ah my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced though perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very rarely of use to any body . i am sure it almost killed me once . come come cried emma feeling this to be an unsafe subject i must beg you not to talk of the sea . it makes me envious and miserable i who have never seen it south end is prohibited if you please . my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr .  perry yet and he never forgets you . oh good mr .  perryhow is he sir why pretty well but not quite well . poor perry is bilious and he has not time to take care of himselfhe tells me he has not time to take care of himselfwhich is very sadbut he is always wanted all round the country . i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere . but then there is not so clever a man any where . and mrs .  perry and the children how are they do the children grow i have a great regard for mr .  perry . i hope he will be calling soon . he will be so pleased to see my little ones . i hope he will be here tomorrow for i have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence . and my dear whenever he comes you had better let him look at little bellas throat . oh my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it . either bathing has been of the greatest service to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr .  wingfields which we have been applying at times ever since august . it is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use to herand if i had known you were wanting an embrocation i would have spoken to you seem to me to have forgotten mrs .  and miss bates said emma i have not heard one inquiry after them . oh the good batesesi am quite ashamed of myselfbut you mention them in most of your letters . i hope they are quite well . good old mrs .  batesi will call upon her tomorrow and take my children . they are always so pleased to see my children . and that excellent miss batessuch thorough worthy people how are they sir why pretty well my dear upon the whole . but poor mrs .  bates had a bad cold about a month ago . how sorry i am but colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn . mr .  wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavyexcept when it has been quite an influenza . that has been a good deal the case my dear but not to the degree you mention . perry says that colds have been very general but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november . perry does not call it altogether a sickly season . no i do not know that mr .  wingfield considers it very sickly except ah my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is always a sickly season . nobody is healthy in london nobody can be . it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there so far off and the air so bad no indeedwe are not at all in a bad air . our part of london is very superior to most othersyou must not confound us with london in general my dear sir . the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very different from almost all the rest . we are so very airy i should be unwilling i own to live in any other part of the town there is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my children in but we are so remarkably airymr . wingfield thinks the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as to air . ah my dear it is not like hartfield . you make the best of it but after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you different creatures you do not look like the same . now i cannot say that i think you are any of you looking well at present . i am sorry to hear you say so sir but i assure you excepting those little nervous headaches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere i am quite well myself and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were a little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness of coming . i hope you will think better of their looks tomorrow for i assure you mr .  wingfield told me that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether in such good case . i trust at least that you do not think mr .  knightley looking ill turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband . middling my dear i cannot compliment you . i think mr .  john knightley very far from looking well . what is the matter sirdid you speak to me cried mr .  john knightley hearing his own name . i am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking wellbut i hope it is only from being a little fatigued . i could have wished however as you know that you had seen mr .  wingfield before you left home . my dear isabellaexclaimed he hastilypray do not concern yourself about my looks . be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children and let me look as i chuse . i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother cried emma about your friend mr .  grahams intending to have a bailiff from scotland to look after his new estate . what will it answer will not the old prejudice be too strong and she talked in this way so long and successfully that when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister she had nothing worse to hear than isabellas kind inquiry after jane fairfax and jane fairfax though no great favourite with her in general she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising . that sweet amiable jane fairfax said mrs .  john knightley . it is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment accidentally in town what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them i always regret excessively on dear emmas account that she cannot be more at highbury but now their daughter is married i suppose colonel and mrs .  campbell will not be able to part with her at all . she would be such a delightful companion for emma . mr .  woodhouse agreed to it all but added our little friend harriet smith however is just such another pretty kind of young person . you will like harriet . emma could not have a better companion than harriet . i am most happy to hear itbut only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superiorand exactly emmas age . this topic was discussed very happily and others succeeded of similar moment and passed away with similar harmony but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation . the gruel came and supplied a great deal to be saidmuch praise and many comments undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerablebut unfortunately among the failures which the daughter had to instance the most recent and therefore most prominent was in her own cook at south end a young woman hired for the time who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel thin but not too thin . often as she had wished for and ordered it she had never been able to get any thing tolerable . here was a dangerous opening . ah said mr .  woodhouse shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern . the ejaculation in emmas ear expressed ah there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to south end . it does not bear talking of . and for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel . after an interval of some minutes however he began with i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn instead of coming here . but why should you be sorry siri assure you it did the children a great deal of good . and moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not have been to south end . south end is an unhealthy place . perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end . i know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is quite a mistake sir . we all had our health perfectly well there never found the least inconvenience from the mud and mr .  wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy and i am sure he may be depended on for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly . you should have gone to cromer my dear if you went anywhere . perry was a week at cromer once and he holds it to be the best of all the seabathing places . a fine open sea he says and very pure air . and by what i understand you might have had lodgings there quite away from the seaa quarter of a mile offvery comfortable . you should have consulted perry . but my dear sir the difference of the journeyonly consider how great it would have been . an hundred miles perhaps instead of forty . ah my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred . better not move at all better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air . this is just what perry said . it seemed to him a very illjudged measure . emmas attempts to stop her father had been vain and when he had reached such a point as this she could not wonder at her brotherinlaws breaking out . mr .  perry said he in a voice of very strong displeasure would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for . why does he make it any business of his to wonder at what i do at my taking my family to one part of the coast or anotheri may be allowed i hope the use of my judgment as well as mr .  perry . i want his directions no more than his drugs . he paused and growing cooler in a moment added with only sarcastic dryness if mr .  perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself . true true cried mr .  knightley with most ready interposition very true . thats a consideration indeed . but john as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows i cannot conceive any difficulty . i should not attempt it if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path .  .  .  . the only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps . i shall see you at the abbey tomorrow morning i hope and then we will look them over and you shall give me your opinion . mr .  woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend perry to whom he had in fact though unconsciously been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil and the immediate alertness of one brother and better recollections of the other prevented any renewal of it . chapter xiii there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs .  john knightley in this short visit to hartfield going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister . she had nothing to wish otherwise but that the days did not pass so swiftly . it was a delightful visitperfect in being much too short . in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings but one complete dinner engagement and out of the house too there was no avoiding though at christmas . mr .  weston would take no denial they must all dine at randalls one dayeven mr .  woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party . how they were all to be conveyed he would have made a difficulty if he could but as his son and daughters carriage and horses were actually at hartfield he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head it hardly amounted to a doubt nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for harriet also . harriet mr .  elton and mr .  knightley their own especial set were the only persons invited to meet themthe hours were to be early as well as the numbers few mr .  woodhouses habits and inclination being consulted in every thing . the evening before this great event for it was a very great event that mr .  woodhouse should dine out on the 24th of december had been spent by harriet at hartfield and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold that but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by mrs .  goddard emma could not have allowed her to leave the house . emma called on her the next day and found her doom already signed with regard to randalls . she was very feverish and had a bad sore throat mrs .  goddard was full of care and affection mr .  perry was talked of and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement though she could not speak of her loss without many tears . emma sat with her as long as she could to attend her in mrs .  goddards unavoidable absences and raise her spirits by representing how much mr .  eltons would be depressed when he knew her state and left her at last tolerably comfortable in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit and of their all missing her very much . she had not advanced many yards from mrs .  goddards door when she was met by mr .  elton himself evidently coming towards it and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid of whom he on the rumour of considerable illness had been going to inquire that he might carry some report of her to hartfield they were overtaken by mr .  john knightley returning from the daily visit to donwell with his two eldest boys whose healthy glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for . they joined company and proceeded together . emma was just describing the nature of her friends complaint a throat very much inflamed with a great deal of heat about her a quick low pulse c .  and she was sorry to find from mrs .  goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sorethroats and had often alarmed her with them . mr .  elton looked all alarm on the occasion as he exclaimed a sorethroati hope not infectious . i hope not of a putrid infectious sort . has perry seen her indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend . let me entreat you to run no risks . why does not perry see her emma who was not really at all frightened herself tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of mrs .  goddards experience and care but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away which she would rather feed and assist than not she added soon afterwardsas if quite another subject it is so cold so very coldand looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party i should really try not to go out todayand dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr .  and mrs .  weston . but upon my word mr .  elton in your case i should certainly excuse myself . you appear to me a little hoarse already and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues tomorrow will bring i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself tonight . mr .  elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make which was exactly the case for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady and not liking to resist any advice of hers he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit but emma too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially or see him with clear vision was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being very cold certainly very cold and walked on rejoicing in having extricated him from randalls and secured him the power of sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening . you do quite right said shewe will make your apologies to mr .  and mrs .  weston . but hardly had she so spoken when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage if the weather were mr .  eltons only objection and mr .  elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction . it was a done thing mr .  elton was to go and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment never had his smile been stronger nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her . well said she to herself this is most strangeafter i had got him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave harriet ill behindmost strange indeedbut there is i believe in many men especially single men such an inclination such a passion for dining outa dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures their employments their dignities almost their duties that any thing gives way to itand this must be the case with mr .  elton a most valuable amiable pleasing young man undoubtedly and very much in love with harriet but still he cannot refuse an invitation he must dine out wherever he is asked . what a strange thing love is he can see ready wit in harriet but will not dine alone for her . soon afterwards mr .  elton quitted them and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming harriet at parting in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at mrs .  goddards for news of her fair friend the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again when he hoped to be able to give a better report and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour . after a few minutes of entire silence between them john knightley began with i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr .  elton . it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned . with men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies to please every feature works . mr .  eltons manners are not perfect replied emma but where there is a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook a great deal . where a man does his best with only moderate powers he will have the advantage over negligent superiority . there is such perfect goodtemper and goodwill in mr .  elton as one cannot but value . yes said mr .  john knightley presently with some slyness he seems to have a great deal of goodwill towards you . me she replied with a smile of astonishment are you imagining me to be mr .  eltons object such an imagination has crossed me i own emma and if it never occurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now . mr .  elton in love with mewhat an idea i do not say it is so but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly . i think your manners to him encouraging . i speak as a friend emma . you had better look about you and ascertain what you do and what you mean to do . i thank you but i assure you you are quite mistaken . mr .  elton and i are very good friends and nothing more and she walked on amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant and in want of counsel . he said no more . mr .  woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit that in spite of the increasing coldness he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others too full of the wonder of his own going and the pleasure it was to afford at randalls to see that it was cold and too well wrapt up to feel it . the cold however was severe and by the time the second carriage was in motion a few flakes of snow were finding their way down and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time . emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour . the preparing and the going abroad in such weather with the sacrifice of his children after dinner were evils were disagreeables at least which mr .  john knightley did not by any means like he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent . a man said he must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside and encounter such a day as this for the sake of coming to see him . he must think himself a most agreeable fellow i could not do such a thing . it is the greatest absurdityactually snowing at this moment the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at homeand the folly of peoples not staying comfortably at home when they can if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this by any call of duty or business what a hardship we should deem itand here are we probably with rather thinner clothing than usual setting forward voluntarily without excuse in defiance of the voice of nature which tells man in every thing given to his view or his feelings to stay at home himself and keep all under shelter that he can here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another mans house with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again tomorrow . going in dismal weather to return probably in worsefour horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home . emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving to emulate the very true my love which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all . she could not be complying she dreaded being quarrelsome her heroism reached only to silence . she allowed him to talk and arranged the glasses and wrapped herself up without opening her lips . they arrived the carriage turned the step was let down and mr .  elton spruce black and smiling was with them instantly . emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject . mr .  elton was all obligation and cheerfulness he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed that she began to think he must have received a different account of harriet from what had reached her . she had sent while dressing and the answer had been much the same not better . my report from mrs .  goddards said she presently was not so pleasant as i had hopednot better was my answer . his face lengthened immediately and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered . oh noi am grieved to findi was on the point of telling you that when i called at mrs .  goddards door which i did the very last thing before i returned to dress i was told that miss smith was not better by no means better rather worse . very much grieved and concerned i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morning . emma smiled and answeredmy visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint i hope but not even i can charm away a sore throat it is a most severe cold indeed . mr .  perry has been with her as you probably heard . yesi imaginedthat isi did not he has been used to her in these complaints and i hope tomorrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report . but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness . such a sad loss to our party today dreadfulexactly so indeed . she will be missed every moment . this was very proper the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable but it should have lasted longer . emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment . what an excellent device said he the use of a sheepskin for carriages . how very comfortable they make itimpossible to feel cold with such precautions . the contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentlemans carriage perfectly complete . one is so fenced and guarded from the weather that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted . weather becomes absolutely of no consequence . it is a very cold afternoonbut in this carriage we know nothing of the matter . ha snows a little i see . yes said john knightley and i think we shall have a good deal of it . christmas weather observed mr .  elton . quite seasonable and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday and prevent this days party which it might very possibly have done for mr .  woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground but now it is of no consequence . this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings . at christmas every body invites their friends about them and people think little of even the worst weather . i was snowed up at a friends house once for a week . nothing could be pleasanter . i went for only one night and could not get away till that very day sennight . mr .  john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure but said only coolly i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls . at another time emma might have been amused but she was too much astonished now at mr .  eltons spirits for other feelings . harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party . we are sure of excellent fires continued he and every thing in the greatest comfort . charming people mr .  and mrs .  weston mrs .  weston indeed is much beyond praise and he is exactly what one values so hospitable and so fond of society it will be a small party but where small parties are select they are perhaps the most agreeable of any . mr .  westons diningroom does not accommodate more than ten comfortably and for my part i would rather under such circumstances fall short by two than exceed by two . i think you will agree with me turning with a soft air to emma i think i shall certainly have your approbation though mr .  knightley perhaps from being used to the large parties of london may not quite enter into our feelings . i know nothing of the large parties of london siri never dine with any body . indeed in a tone of wonder and pity i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery . well sir the time must come when you will be paid for all this when you will have little labour and great enjoyment . my first enjoyment replied john knightley as they passed through the sweepgate will be to find myself safe at hartfield again . chapter xiv some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs .  westons drawingroommr . elton must compose his joyous looks and mr .  john knightley disperse his illhumour . mr .  elton must smile less and mr .  john knightley more to fit them for the place . emma only might be as nature prompted and shew herself just as happy as she was . to her it was real enjoyment to be with the westons . mr .  weston was a great favourite and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve as to his wife not any one to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood of being always interesting and always intelligible the little affairs arrangements perplexities and pleasures of her father and herself . she could tell nothing of hartfield in which mrs .  weston had not a lively concern and half an hours uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends was one of the first gratifications of each . this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole days visit might not afford which certainly did not belong to the present halfhour but the very sight of mrs .  weston her smile her touch her voice was grateful to emma and she determined to think as little as possible of mr .  eltons oddities or of any thing else unpleasant and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost . the misfortune of harriets cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival . mr .  woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it besides all the history of his own and isabellas coming and of emmas being to follow and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come and see his daughter when the others appeared and mrs .  weston who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma . emmas project of forgetting mr .  elton for a while made her rather sorry to find when they had all taken their places that he was close to her . the difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards harriet from her mind while he not only sat at her elbow but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion . instead of forgetting him his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of can it really be as my brother imagined can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to meabsurd and insufferable yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm would be so interested about her father and so delighted with mrs .  weston and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a wouldbe lover and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners . for her own sake she could not be rude and for harriets in the hope that all would yet turn out right she was even positively civil but it was an effort especially as something was going on amongst the others in the most overpowering period of mr .  eltons nonsense which she particularly wished to listen to . she heard enough to know that mr .  weston was giving some information about his son she heard the words my son and frank and my son repeated several times over and from a few other halfsyllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son but before she could quiet mr .  elton the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward . now it so happened that in spite of emmas resolution of never marrying there was something in the name in the idea of mr .  frank churchill which always interested her . she had frequently thoughtespecially since his fathers marriage with miss taylorthat if she were to marry he was the very person to suit her in age character and condition . he seemed by this connexion between the families quite to belong to her . she could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of . that mr .  and mrs .  weston did think of it she was very strongly persuaded and though not meaning to be induced by him or by any body else to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for she had a great curiosity to see him a decided intention of finding him pleasant of being liked by him to a certain degree and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends imaginations . with such sensations mr .  eltons civilities were dreadfully illtimed but she had the comfort of appearing very polite while feeling very crossand of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again or the substance of it from the openhearted mr .  weston . so it proved for when happily released from mr .  elton and seated by mr .  weston at dinner he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton to say to her we want only two more to be just the right number . i should like to see two more hereyour pretty little friend miss smith and my sonand then i should say we were quite complete . i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawingroom that we are expecting frank . i had a letter from him this morning and he will be with us within a fortnight . emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure and fully assented to his proposition of mr .  frank churchill and miss smith making their party quite complete . he has been wanting to come to us continued mr .  weston ever since september every letter has been full of it but he cannot command his own time . he has those to please who must be pleased and who between ourselves are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices . but now i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january . what a very great pleasure it will be to you and mrs .  weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as yourself . yes she would be but that she thinks there will be another putoff . she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do but she does not know the parties so well as i do . the case you see isbut this is quite between ourselves i did not mention a syllable of it in the other room . there are secrets in all families you knowthe case is that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at enscombe in january and that franks coming depends upon their being put off . if they are not put off he cannot stir . but i know they will because it is a family that a certain lady of some consequence at enscombe has a particular dislike to and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years they always are put off when it comes to the point . i have not the smallest doubt of the issue . i am as confident of seeing frank here before the middle of january as i am of being here myself but your good friend there nodding towards the upper end of the table has so few vagaries herself and has been so little used to them at hartfield that she cannot calculate on their effects as i have been long in the practice of doing . i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case replied emma but am disposed to side with you mr .  weston . if you think he will come i shall think so too for you know enscombe . yesi have some right to that knowledge though i have never been at the place in my life . she is an odd womanbut i never allow myself to speak ill of her on franks account for i do believe her to be very fond of him . i used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body except herself but she has always been kind to him in her wayallowing for little whims and caprices and expecting every thing to be as she likes . and it is no small credit in my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection for though i would not say it to any body else she has no more heart than a stone to people in general and the devil of a temper . emma liked the subject so well that she began upon it to mrs .  weston very soon after their moving into the drawingroom wishing her joy yet observing that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming . mrs .  weston agreed to it but added that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of for i cannot depend upon his coming . i cannot be so sanguine as mr .  weston . i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing . mr .  weston i dare say has been telling you exactly how the matter stands yesit seems to depend upon nothing but the illhumour of mrs .  churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world . my emma replied mrs .  weston smiling what is the certainty of caprice then turning to isabella who had not been attending beforeyou must know my dear mrs .  knightley that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr .  frank churchill in my opinion as his father thinks . it depends entirely upon his aunts spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper . to youto my two daughtersi may venture on the truth . mrs .  churchill rules at enscombe and is a very oddtempered woman and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him . oh mrs .  churchill every body knows mrs .  churchill replied isabella and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion . to be constantly living with an illtempered person must be dreadful . it is what we happily have never known any thing of but it must be a life of misery . what a blessing that she never had any children poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them emma wished she had been alone with mrs .  weston . she should then have heard more mrs .  weston would speak to her with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with isabella and she really believed would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills from her excepting those views on the young man of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge . but at present there was nothing more to be said . mr .  woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawingroom . to be sitting long after dinner was a confinement that he could not endure . neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable . while he talked to isabella however emma found an opportunity of saying and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain . i am sorry for it . the introduction must be unpleasant whenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better . yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays . even if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us . i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills to keep him to themselves . there is jealousy . they are jealous even of his regard for his father . in short i can feel no dependence on his coming and i wish mr .  weston were less sanguine . he ought to come said emma . if he could stay only a couple of days he ought to come and one can hardly conceive a young mans not having it in his power to do as much as that . a young woman if she fall into bad hands may be teazed and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young mans being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he likes it . one ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family before one decides upon what he can do replied mrs .  weston . one ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family but enscombe i believe certainly must not be judged by general rules she is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her . but she is so fond of the nephew he is so very great a favourite . now according to my idea of mrs .  churchill it would be most natural that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband to whom she owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice towards him she should frequently be governed by the nephew to whom she owes nothing at all . my dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper to understand a bad one or to lay down rules for it you must let it go its own way . i have no doubt of his having at times considerable influence but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand when it will be . emma listened and then coolly said i shall not be satisfied unless he comes . he may have a great deal of influence on some points continued mrs .  weston and on others very little and among those on which she is beyond his reach it is but too likely may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us . chapter xv mr .  woodhouse was soon ready for his tea and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home and it was as much as his three companions could do to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour before the other gentlemen appeared . mr .  weston was chatty and convivial and no friend to early separations of any sort but at last the drawingroom party did receive an augmentation . mr .  elton in very good spirits was one of the first to walk in . mrs .  weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa . he joined them immediately and with scarcely an invitation seated himself between them . emma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of mr .  frank churchill was willing to forget his late improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before and on his making harriet his very first subject was ready to listen with most friendly smiles . he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend her fair lovely amiable friend . did she knowhad she heard any thing about her since their being at randalls he felt much anxietyhe must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably . and in this style he talked on for some time very properly not much attending to any answer but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat and emma was quite in charity with him . but at last there seemed a perverse turn it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account than on harrietsmore anxious that she should escape the infection than that there should be no infection in the complaint . he began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sickchamber again for the presentto entreat her to promise him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr .  perry and learnt his opinion and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her . she was vexed . it did appearthere was no concealing itexactly like the pretence of being in love with her instead of harriet an inconstancy if real the most contemptible and abominable and she had difficulty in behaving with temper . he turned to mrs .  weston to implore her assistance would not she give him her supportwould not she add her persuasions to his to induce miss woodhouse not to go to mrs .  goddards till it were certain that miss smiths disorder had no infection he could not be satisfied without a promise would not she give him her influence in procuring it so scrupulous for others he continued and yet so careless for herself she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home today and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself . is this fair mrs .  westonjudge between us . have not i some right to complain i am sure of your kind support and aid . emma saw mrs .  westons surprize and felt that it must be great at an address which in words and manner was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her and as for herself she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose . she could only give him a look but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses and then left the sofa removing to a seat by her sister and giving her all her attention . she had not time to know how mr .  elton took the reproof so rapidly did another subject succeed for mr .  john knightley now came into the room from examining the weather and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow and of its still snowing fast with a strong drifting wind concluding with these words to mr .  woodhouse this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements sir . something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow . poor mr .  woodhouse was silent from consternation but every body else had something to say every body was either surprized or not surprized and had some question to ask or some comfort to offer . mrs .  weston and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his soninlaw who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly . i admired your resolution very much sir said he in venturing out in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow very soon . every body must have seen the snow coming on . i admired your spirit and i dare say we shall get home very well . another hour or twos snow can hardly make the road impassable and we are two carriages if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand . i dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight . mr .  weston with triumph of a different sort was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time but had not said a word lest it should make mr .  woodhouse uncomfortable and be an excuse for his hurrying away . as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return that was a mere joke he was afraid they would find no difficulty . he wished the road might be impassable that he might be able to keep them all at randalls and with the utmost goodwill was sure that accommodation might be found for every body calling on his wife to agree with him that with a little contrivance every body might be lodged which she hardly knew how to do from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house . what is to be done my dear emmawhat is to be done was mr .  woodhouses first exclamation and all that he could say for some time . to her he looked for comfort and her assurances of safety her representation of the excellence of the horses and of james and of their having so many friends about them revived him a little . his eldest daughters alarm was equal to his own . the horror of being blocked up at randalls while her children were at hartfield was full in her imagination and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people but in a state that admitted no delay she was eager to have it settled that her father and emma should remain at randalls while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them . you had better order the carriage directly my love said she i dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly and if we do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk . i am not at all afraid . i should not mind walking half the way . i could change my shoes you know the moment i got home and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold . indeed replied he . then my dear isabella it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every thing does give you cold . walk homeyou are prettily shod for walking home i dare say . it will be bad enough for the horses . isabella turned to mrs .  weston for her approbation of the plan . mrs .  weston could only approve . isabella then went to emma but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away and they were still discussing the point when mr .  knightley who had left the room immediately after his brothers first report of the snow came back again and told them that he had been out of doors to examine and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home whenever they liked it either now or an hour hence . he had gone beyond the sweep some way along the highbury roadthe snow was nowhere above half an inch deepin many places hardly enough to whiten the ground a very few flakes were falling at present but the clouds were parting and there was every appearance of its being soon over . he had seen the coachmen and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend . to isabella the relief of such tidings was very great and they were scarcely less acceptable to emma on her fathers account who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at randalls . he was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay and while the others were variously urging and recommending mr .  knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences thus your father will not be easy why do not you go i am ready if the others are . shall i ring the bell yes do . and the bell was rung and the carriages spoken for . a few minutes more and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house to get sober and cool and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over . the carriage came and mr .  woodhouse always the first object on such occasions was carefully attended to his own by mr .  knightley and mr .  weston but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for . he was afraid they should have a very bad drive . he was afraid poor isabella would not like it . and there would be poor emma in the carriage behind . he did not know what they had best do . they must keep as much together as they could and james was talked to and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage . isabella stept in after her father john knightley forgetting that he did not belong to their party stept in after his wife very naturally so that emma found on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by mr .  elton that the door was to be lawfully shut on them and that they were to have a teteatete drive . it would not have been the awkwardness of a moment it would have been rather a pleasure previous to the suspicions of this very day she could have talked to him of harriet and the threequarters of a mile would have seemed but one . but now she would rather it had not happened . she believed he had been drinking too much of mr .  westons good wine and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense . to restrain him as much as might be by her own manners she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night but scarcely had she begun scarcely had they passed the sweepgate and joined the other carriage than she found her subject cut upher hand seizedher attention demanded and mr .  elton actually making violent love to her availing himself of the precious opportunity declaring sentiments which must be already well known hopingfearingadoringready to die if she refused him but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect and in short very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible . it really was so . without scruplewithout apology without much apparent diffidence mr .  elton the lover of harriet was professing himself her lover . she tried to stop him but vainly he would go on and say it all . angry as she was the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak . she felt that half this folly must be drunkenness and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour . accordingly with a mixture of the serious and the playful which she hoped would best suit his half and half state she replied i am very much astonished mr .  elton . this to me you forget yourself you take me for my friendany message to miss smith i shall be happy to deliver but no more of this to me if you please . miss smithmessage to miss smithwhat could she possibly mean and he repeated her words with such assurance of accent such boastful pretence of amazement that she could not help replying with quickness mr .  elton this is the most extraordinary conduct and i can account for it only in one way you are not yourself or you could not speak either to me or of harriet in such a manner . command yourself enough to say no more and i will endeavour to forget it . but mr .  elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits not at all to confuse his intellects . he perfectly knew his own meaning and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious and slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friend but acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned at allhe resumed the subject of his own passion and was very urgent for a favourable answer . as she thought less of his inebriety she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption and with fewer struggles for politeness replied it is impossible for me to doubt any longer . you have made yourself too clear . mr .  elton my astonishment is much beyond any thing i can express . after such behaviour as i have witnessed during the last month to miss smithsuch attentions as i have been in the daily habit of observingto be addressing me in this mannerthis is an unsteadiness of character indeed which i had not supposed possible believe me sir i am far very far from gratified in being the object of such professions . good heaven cried mr .  elton what can be the meaning of this miss smithi never thought of miss smith in the whole course of my existencenever paid her any attentions but as your friend never cared whether she were dead or alive but as your friend . if she has fancied otherwise her own wishes have misled her and i am very sorryextremely sorrybut miss smith indeedoh miss woodhouse who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse is near no upon my honour there is no unsteadiness of character . i have thought only of you . i protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else . every thing that i have said or done for many weeks past has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself . you cannot really seriously doubt it . noin an accent meant to be insinuatingi am sure you have seen and understood me . it would be impossible to say what emma felt on hearing this which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost . she was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for mr .  eltons sanguine state of mind he tried to take her hand again as he joyously exclaimed charming miss woodhouse allow me to interpret this interesting silence . it confesses that you have long understood me . no sir cried emma it confesses no such thing . so far from having long understood you i have been in a most complete error with respect to your views till this moment . as to myself i am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings nothing could be farther from my wishesyour attachment to my friend harrietyour pursuit of her pursuit it appeared gave me great pleasure and i have been very earnestly wishing you success but had i supposed that she were not your attraction to hartfield i should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent . am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to miss smiththat you have never thought seriously of her never madam cried he affronted in his turn never i assure you . i think seriously of miss smithmiss smith is a very good sort of girl and i should be happy to see her respectably settled . i wish her extremely well and no doubt there are men who might not object toevery body has their level but as for myself i am not i think quite so much at a loss . i need not so totally despair of an equal alliance as to be addressing myself to miss smith no madam my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only and the encouragement i received encouragementi give you encouragementsir you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it . i have seen you only as the admirer of my friend . in no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance . i am exceedingly sorry but it is well that the mistake ends where it does . had the same behaviour continued miss smith might have been led into a misconception of your views not being aware probably any more than myself of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of . but as it is the disappointment is single and i trust will not be lasting . i have no thoughts of matrimony at present . he was too angry to say another word her manner too decided to invite supplication and in this state of swelling resentment and mutually deep mortification they had to continue together a few minutes longer for the fears of mr .  woodhouse had confined them to a footpace . if there had not been so much anger there would have been desperate awkwardness but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment . without knowing when the carriage turned into vicarage lane or when it stopped they found themselves all at once at the door of his house and he was out before another syllable passed . emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night . the compliment was just returned coldly and proudly and under indescribable irritation of spirits she was then conveyed to hartfield . there she was welcomed with the utmost delight by her father who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from vicarage laneturning a corner which he could never bear to think of and in strange handsa mere common coachmanno james and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well for mr .  john knightley ashamed of his illhumour was now all kindness and attention and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father as to seemif not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruelperfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party except herself . but her mind had never been in such perturbation and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection . chapter xvi the hair was curled and the maid sent away and emma sat down to think and be miserable . it was a wretched business indeedsuch an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing forsuch a development of every thing most unwelcomesuch a blow for harrietthat was the worst of all . every part of it brought pain and humiliation of some sort or other but compared with the evil to harriet all was light and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken more in errormore disgraced by misjudgment than she actually was could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself . if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man i could have borne any thing . he might have doubled his presumption to me but poor harriet how she could have been so deceivedhe protested that he had never thought seriously of harrietnever she looked back as well as she could but it was all confusion . she had taken up the idea she supposed and made every thing bend to it . his manners however must have been unmarked wavering dubious or she could not have been so misled . the picturehow eager he had been about the picture and the charadeand an hundred other circumstances how clearly they had seemed to point at harriet . to be sure the charade with its ready witbut then the soft eyes in fact it suited neither it was a jumble without taste or truth . who could have seen through such thickheaded nonsense certainly she had often especially of late thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant but it had passed as his way as a mere error of judgment of knowledge of taste as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society that with all the gentleness of his address true elegance was sometimes wanting but till this very day she had never for an instant suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as harriets friend . to mr .  john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject for the first start of its possibility . there was no denying that those brothers had penetration . she remembered what mr .  knightley had once said to her about mr .  elton the caution he had given the conviction he had professed that mr .  elton would never marry indiscreetly and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself . it was dreadfully mortifying but mr .  elton was proving himself in many respects the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him proud assuming conceited very full of his own claims and little concerned about the feelings of others . contrary to the usual course of things mr .  eltons wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion . his professions and his proposals did him no service . she thought nothing of his attachment and was insulted by his hopes . he wanted to marry well and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her pretended to be in love but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for . there had been no real affection either in his language or manners . sighs and fine words had been given in abundance but she could hardly devise any set of expressions or fancy any tone of voice less allied with real love . she need not trouble herself to pity him . he only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself and if miss woodhouse of hartfield the heiress of thirty thousand pounds were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied he would soon try for miss somebody else with twenty or with ten . butthat he should talk of encouragement should consider her as aware of his views accepting his attentions meaning in short to marry himshould suppose himself her equal in connexion or mindlook down upon her friend so well understanding the gradations of rank below him and be so blind to what rose above as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her it was most provoking . perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent and all the elegancies of mind . the very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior . he must know that the woodhouses had been settled for several generations at hartfield the younger branch of a very ancient familyand that the eltons were nobody . the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate to which all the rest of highbury belonged but their fortune from other sources was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself in every other kind of consequence and the woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which mr .  elton had first entered not two years ago to make his way as he could without any alliances but in trade or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility . but he had fancied her in love with him that evidently must have been his dependence and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging so full of courtesy and attention as supposing her real motive unperceived might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy like mr .  elton in fancying himself a very decided favourite . if she had so misinterpreted his feelings she had little right to wonder that he with selfinterest to blind him should have mistaken hers . the first error and the worst lay at her door . it was foolish it was wrong to take so active a part in bringing any two people together . it was adventuring too far assuming too much making light of what ought to be serious a trick of what ought to be simple . she was quite concerned and ashamed and resolved to do such things no more . here have i said she actually talked poor harriet into being very much attached to this man . she might never have thought of him but for me and certainly never would have thought of him with hope if i had not assured her of his attachment for she is as modest and humble as i used to think him . oh that i had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young martin . there i was quite right . that was well done of me but there i should have stopped and left the rest to time and chance . i was introducing her into good company and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having i ought not to have attempted more . but now poor girl her peace is cut up for some time . i have been but half a friend to her and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much i am sure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for herwilliam coxeoh no i could not endure william coxe a pert young lawyer . she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse and then resumed a more serious more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been and might be and must be . the distressing explanation she had to make to harriet and all that poor harriet would be suffering with the awkwardness of future meetings the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance of subduing feelings concealing resentment and avoiding eclat were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully . to youth and natural cheerfulness like emmas though under temporary gloom at night the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits . the youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy and of powerful operation and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope . emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her and to depend on getting tolerably out of it . it was a great consolation that mr .  elton should not be really in love with her or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint himthat harriets nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive and that there could be no necessity for any bodys knowing what had passed except the three principals and especially for her fathers being given a moments uneasiness about it . these were very cheering thoughts and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present . the weather was most favourable for her though christmas day she could not go to church . mr .  woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas . the ground covered with snow and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise every morning beginning in rain or snow and every evening setting in to freeze she was for many days a most honourable prisoner . no intercourse with harriet possible but by note no church for her on sunday any more than on christmas day and no need to find excuses for mr .  eltons absenting himself . it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house too wise to stir out and to hear him say to mr .  knightley whom no weather could keep entirely from them ah mr .  knightley why do not you stay at home like poor mr .  elton these days of confinement would have been but for her private perplexities remarkably comfortable as such seclusion exactly suited her brother whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions and he had besides so thoroughly cleared off his illhumour at randalls that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at hartfield . he was always agreeable and obliging and speaking pleasantly of every body . but with all the hopes of cheerfulness and all the present comfort of delay there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with harriet as made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease . chapter xvii mr .  and mrs .  john knightley were not detained long at hartfield . the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move and mr .  woodhouse having as usual tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children was obliged to see the whole party set off and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor isabellawhich poor isabella passing her life with those she doated on full of their merits blind to their faults and always innocently busy might have been a model of right feminine happiness . the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from mr .  elton to mr .  woodhouse a long civil ceremonious note to say with mr .  eltons best compliments that he was proposing to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath where in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends he had engaged to spend a few weeks and very much regretted the impossibility he was under from various circumstances of weather and business of taking a personal leave of mr .  woodhouse of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense and had mr .  woodhouse any commands should be happy to attend to them . emma was most agreeably surprized . mr . eltons absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired . she admired him for contriving it though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced . resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father from which she was so pointedly excluded . she had not even a share in his opening compliments . her name was not mentioned and there was so striking a change in all this and such an illjudged solemnity of leavetaking in his graceful acknowledgments as she thought at first could not escape her fathers suspicion . it did however . her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey and his fears that mr .  elton might never get safely to the end of it and saw nothing extraordinary in his language . it was a very useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening . mr .  woodhouse talked over his alarms and emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude . she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark . she had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentlemans return . she went to mrs .  goddards accordingly the very next day to undergo the necessary penance of communication and a severe one it was . she had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feedingto appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and misjudging in all her ideas on one subject all her observations all her convictions all her prophecies for the last six weeks . the confession completely renewed her first shameand the sight of harriets tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again . harriet bore the intelligence very wellblaming nobody and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend . emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost and all that was amiable all that ought to be attaching seemed on harriets side not her own . harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of . the affection of such a man as mr .  elton would have been too great a distinction . she never could have deserved himand nobody but so partial and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible . her tears fell abundantlybut her grief was so truly artless that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emmas eyes and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understandingreally for the time convinced that harriet was the superior creature of the twoand that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do . it was rather too late in the day to set about being simpleminded and ignorant but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet and repressing imagination all the rest of her life . her second duty now inferior only to her fathers claims was to promote harriets comfort and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by matchmaking . she got her to hartfield and shewed her the most unvarying kindness striving to occupy and amuse her and by books and conversation to drive mr .  elton from her thoughts . time she knew must be allowed for this being thoroughly done and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr .  elton in particular but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriets age and with the entire extinction of all hope such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of mr .  eltons return as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them . harriet did think him all perfection and maintained the nonexistence of any body equal to him in person or goodnessand did in truth prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen but yet it appeared to her so natural so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort unrequited that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force . if mr .  elton on his return made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do she could not imagine harriets persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him . their being fixed so absolutely fixed in the same place was bad for each for all three . not one of them had the power of removal or of effecting any material change of society . they must encounter each other and make the best of it . harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at mrs .  goddards mr .  elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school and it must be at hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth . where the wound had been given there must the cure be found if anywhere and emma felt that till she saw her in the way of cure there could be no true peace for herself . chapter xviii mr .  frank churchill did not come . when the time proposed drew near mrs .  westons fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse . for the present he could not be spared to his very great mortification and regret but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period . mrs .  weston was exceedingly disappointedmuch more disappointed in fact than her husband though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober but a sanguine temper though for ever expecting more good than occurs does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression . it soon flies over the present failure and begins to hope again . for half an hour mr .  weston was surprized and sorry but then he began to perceive that franks coming two or three months later would be a much better plan better time of year better weather and that he would be able without any doubt to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner . these feelings rapidly restored his comfort while mrs .  weston of a more apprehensive disposition foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer suffered a great deal more herself . emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about mr .  frank churchills not coming except as a disappointment at randalls . the acquaintance at present had no charm for her . she wanted rather to be quiet and out of temptation but still as it was desirable that she should appear in general like her usual self she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance and enter as warmly into mr .  and mrs .  westons disappointment as might naturally belong to their friendship . she was the first to announce it to mr .  knightley and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary or being acting a part perhaps rather more at the conduct of the churchills in keeping him away . she then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry the pleasure of looking at somebody new the galaday to highbury entire which the sight of him would have made and ending with reflections on the churchills again found herself directly involved in a disagreement with mr .  knightley and to her great amusement perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion and making use of mrs .  westons arguments against herself . the churchills are very likely in fault said mr .  knightley coolly but i dare say he might come if he would . i do not know why you should say so . he wishes exceedingly to come but his uncle and aunt will not spare him . i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made a point of it . it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof . how odd you are what has mr .  frank churchill done to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure from living with those who have always set him the example of it . it is a great deal more natural than one could wish that a young man brought up by those who are proud luxurious and selfish should be proud luxurious and selfish too . if frank churchill had wanted to see his father he would have contrived it between september and january . a man at his agewhat is hethree or fourandtwentycannot be without the means of doing as much as that . it is impossible . thats easily said and easily felt by you who have always been your own master . you are the worst judge in the world mr .  knightley of the difficulties of dependence . you do not know what it is to have tempers to manage . it is not to be conceived that a man of three or fourandtwenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount . he cannot want moneyhe cannot want leisure . we know on the contrary that he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom . we hear of him for ever at some wateringplace or other . a little while ago he was at weymouth . this proves that he can leave the churchills . yes sometimes he can . and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while whenever there is any temptation of pleasure . it is very unfair to judge of any bodys conduct without an intimate knowledge of their situation . nobody who has not been in the interior of a family can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be . we ought to be acquainted with enscombe and with mrs .  churchills temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do . he may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others . there is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses and that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and resolution . it is frank churchills duty to pay this attention to his father . he knows it to be so by his promises and messages but if he wished to do it it might be done . a man who felt rightly would say at once simply and resolutely to mrs .  churchill every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience but i must go and see my father immediately . i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion . i shall therefore set off tomorrow . if he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becoming a man there would be no opposition made to his going . no said emma laughing but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again . such language for a young man entirely dependent to usenobody but you mr .  knightley would imagine it possible . but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own . mr .  frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for himstanding up in the middle of the room i suppose and speaking as loud as he couldhow can you imagine such conduct practicable depend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it . he would feel himself in the right and the declarationmade of course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner would do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do . respect would be added to affection . they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims . respect for right conduct is felt by every body . if he would act in this sort of manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend to his . i rather doubt that . you are very fond of bending little minds but where little minds belong to rich people in authority i think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones . i can imagine that if you as you are mr .  knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in mr .  frank churchills situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect . the churchills might not have a word to say in return but then you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through . to him who has it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought . he may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have without being so equal under particular circumstances to act up to it . then it would not be so strong a sense . if it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction . oh the difference of situation and habit i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life . our amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others . it ought to have been a habit with him by this time of following his duty instead of consulting expediency . i can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man . as he became rational he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority . he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father . had he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulty now . we shall never agree about him cried emma but that is nothing extraordinary . i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man i feel sure that he is not . mr .  weston would not be blind to folly though in his own son but he is very likely to have a more yielding complying mild disposition than would suit your notions of mans perfection . i dare say he has and though it may cut him off from some advantages it will secure him many others . yes all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it . he can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his fathers having any right to complain . his letters disgust me . your feelings are singular . they seem to satisfy every body else . i suspect they do not satisfy mrs .  weston . they hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings standing in a mothers place but without a mothers affection to blind her . it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due and she must doubly feel the omission . had she been a person of consequence herself he would have come i dare say and it would not have signified whether he did or no . can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself no emma your amiable young man can be amiable only in french not in english . he may be very aimable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people nothing really amiable about him . you seem determined to think ill of him . menot at all replied mr .  knightley rather displeased i do not want to think ill of him . i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man but i hear of none except what are merely personal that he is wellgrown and goodlooking with smooth plausible manners . well if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a treasure at highbury . we do not often look upon fine young men wellbred and agreeable . we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain . cannot you imagine mr .  knightley what a sensation his coming will produce there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interest one object of curiosity it will be all mr .  frank churchill we shall think and speak of nobody else . you will excuse my being so much overpowered . if i find him conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only a chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts . my idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable . to you he will talk of farming to me of drawing or music and so on to every body having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead or take the lead just as propriety may require and to speak extremely well on each that is my idea of him . and mine said mr .  knightley warmly is that if he turn out any thing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing what at threeandtwenty to be the king of his companythe great man the practised politician who is to read every bodys character and make every bodys talents conduce to the display of his own superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself my dear emma your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point . i will say no more about him cried emma you turn every thing to evil . we are both prejudiced you against i for him and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here . prejudiced i am not prejudiced . but i am very much and without being at all ashamed of it . my love for mr .  and mrs .  weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour . he is a person i never think of from one months end to another said mr .  knightley with a degree of vexation which made emma immediately talk of something else though she could not comprehend why he should be angry . to take a dislike to a young man only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him for with all the high opinion of himself which she had often laid to his charge she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another . emma and harriet had been walking together one morning and in emmas opinion had been talking enough of mr .  elton for that day . she could not think that harriets solace or her own sins required more and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returnedbut it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive mr .  elton is so good to the poor she found something else must be done . they were just approaching the house where lived mrs .  and miss bates . she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers . there was always sufficient reason for such an attention mrs .  and miss bates loved to be called on and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her as rather negligent in that respect and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts . she had had many a hint from mr .  knightley and some from her own heart as to her deficiencybut none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeablea waste of timetiresome women and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the secondrate and thirdrate of highbury who were calling on them for ever and therefore she seldom went near them . but now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going inobserving as she proposed it to harriet that as well as she could calculate they were just now quite safe from any letter from jane fairfax . the house belonged to people in business . mrs .  and miss bates occupied the drawingroom floor and there in the very moderatesized apartment which was every thing to them the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed the quiet neat old lady who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner wanting even to give up her place to miss woodhouse and her more active talking daughter almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness thanks for their visit solicitude for their shoes anxious inquiries after mr .  woodhouses health cheerful communications about her mothers and sweetcake from the beaufetmrs . cole had just been there just called in for ten minutes and had been so good as to sit an hour with them and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much and therefore she hoped miss woodhouse and miss smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too . the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr .  elton . there was intimacy between them and mr .  cole had heard from mr .  elton since his going away . emma knew what was coming they must have the letter over again and settle how long he had been gone and how much he was engaged in company and what a favourite he was wherever he went and how full the master of the ceremonies ball had been and she went through it very well with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite and always putting forward to prevent harriets being obliged to say a word . this she had been prepared for when she entered the house but meant having once talked him handsomely over to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic and to wander at large amongst all the mistresses and misses of highbury and their cardparties . she had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr .  elton but he was actually hurried off by miss bates she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the coles to usher in a letter from her niece . oh yesmr . elton i understandcertainly as to dancing mrs .  cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was mrs .  cole was so kind as to sit some time with us talking of jane for as soon as she came in she began inquiring after her jane is so very great a favourite there . whenever she is with us mrs .  cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can . and so she began inquiring after her directly saying i know you cannot have heard from jane lately because it is not her time for writing and when i immediately said but indeed we have we had a letter this very morning i do not know that i ever saw any body more surprized . have you upon your honour said she well that is quite unexpected . do let me hear what she says . emmas politeness was at hand directly to say with smiling interest have you heard from miss fairfax so lately i am extremely happy . i hope she is well thank you . you are so kind replied the happily deceived aunt while eagerly hunting for the letter . oh here it is . i was sure it could not be far off but i had put my huswife upon it you see without being aware and so it was quite hid but i had it in my hand so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table . i was reading it to mrs .  cole and since she went away i was reading it again to my mother for it is such a pleasure to her a letter from janethat she can never hear it often enough so i knew it could not be far off and here it is only just under my huswifeand since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she saysbut first of all i really must in justice to jane apologise for her writing so short a letteronly two pages you see hardly twoand in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half . my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well . she often says when the letter is first opened well hetty now i think you will be put to it to make out all that checkerwork dont you maamand then i tell her i am sure she would contrive to make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her every word of iti am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word . and indeed though my mothers eyes are not so good as they were she can see amazingly well still thank god with the help of spectacles . it is such a blessing my mothers are really very good indeed . jane often says when she is here i am sure grandmama you must have had very strong eyes to see as you doand so much fine work as you have done tooi only wish my eyes may last me as well . all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss fairfaxs handwriting . you are extremely kind replied miss bates highly gratified you who are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself . i am sure there is nobodys praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouses . my mother does not hear she is a little deaf you know . maam addressing her do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about janes handwriting and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it . she was pondering in the meanwhile upon the possibility without seeming very rude of making her escape from jane fairfaxs letter and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse when miss bates turned to her again and seized her attention . my mothers deafness is very trifling you seejust nothing at all . by only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over she is sure to hear but then she is used to my voice . but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me . jane speaks so distinct however she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago which is saying a great deal at my mothers time of lifeand it really is full two years you know since she was here . we never were so long without seeing her before and as i was telling mrs .  cole we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now . are you expecting miss fairfax here soon oh yes next week . indeedthat must be a very great pleasure . thank you . you are very kind . yes next week . every body is so surprized and every body says the same obliging things . i am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury as they can be to see her . yes friday or saturday she cannot say which because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days . so very good of them to send her the whole way but they always do you know . oh yes friday or saturday next . that is what she writes about . that is the reason of her writing out of rule as we call it for in the common course we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday . yes so i imagined . i was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax today . so obliging of you no we should not have heard if it had not been for this particular circumstance of her being to come here so soon . my mother is so delightedfor she is to be three months with us at least . three months she says so positively as i am going to have the pleasure of reading to you . the case is you see that the campbells are going to ireland . mrs .  dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly . they had not intended to go over till the summer but she is so impatient to see them againfor till she married last october she was never away from them so much as a week which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms i was going to say but however different countries and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her motheror her father i declare i do not know which it was but we shall see presently in janes letterwrote in mr .  dixons name as well as her own to press their coming over directly and they would give them the meeting in dublin and take them back to their country seat balycraig a beautiful place i fancy . jane has heard a great deal of its beauty from mr .  dixon i mean i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else but it was very natural you know that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addressesand as jane used to be very often walking out with themfor colonel and mrs .  campbell were very particular about their daughters not walking out often with only mr .  dixon for which i do not at all blame them of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell about his own home in ireland and i think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he had taken himself . he is a most amiable charming young man i believe . jane was quite longing to go to ireland from his account of things . at this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emmas brain with regard to jane fairfax this charming mr .  dixon and the not going to ireland she said with the insidious design of farther discovery you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time . considering the very particular friendship between her and mrs .  dixon you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs .  campbell . very true very true indeed . the very thing that we have always been rather afraid of for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us for months togethernot able to come if any thing was to happen . but you see every thing turns out for the best . they want her mr .  and mrs .  dixon excessively to come over with colonel and mrs .  campbell quite depend upon it nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation jane says as you will hear presently mr .  dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention . he is a most charming young man . ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth when they were out in that party on the water and she by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails would have been dashed into the sea at once and actually was all but gone if he had not with the greatest presence of mind caught hold of her habit i can never think of it without tremblingbut ever since we had the history of that day i have been so fond of mr .  dixon but in spite of all her friends urgency and her own wish of seeing ireland miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and mrs .  bates yesentirely her own doing entirely her own choice and colonel and mrs .  campbell think she does quite right just what they should recommend and indeed they particularly wish her to try her native air as she has not been quite so well as usual lately . i am concerned to hear of it . i think they judge wisely . but mrs .  dixon must be very much disappointed . mrs .  dixon i understand has no remarkable degree of personal beauty is not by any means to be compared with miss fairfax . oh no . you are very obliging to say such thingsbut certainly not . there is no comparison between them . miss campbell always was absolutely plainbut extremely elegant and amiable . yes that of course . jane caught a bad cold poor thing so long ago as the 7th of november as i am going to read to you and has never been well since . a long time is not it for a cold to hang upon her she never mentioned it before because she would not alarm us . just like her so consideratebut however she is so far from well that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home and try an air that always agrees with her and they have no doubt that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here than go to ireland if she is unwell . nobody could nurse her as we should do . it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world . and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following as you will find from janes letter . so suddenyou may guess dear miss woodhouse what a flurry it has thrown me in if it was not for the drawback of her illnessbut i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly . i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that . i always make a point of reading janes letters through to myself first before i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her . jane desired me to do it so i always do and so i began today with my usual caution but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i burst out quite frightened with bless me poor jane is ill which my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed at . however when i read on i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first and i make so light of it now to her that she does not think much about it . but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my guard . if jane does not get well soon we will call in mr .  perry . the expense shall not be thought of and though he is so liberal and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know . he has a wife and family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time . well now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about we will turn to her letter and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her . i am afraid we must be running away said emma glancing at harriet and beginning to risemy father will be expecting us . i had no intention i thought i had no power of staying more than five minutes when i first entered the house . i merely called because i would not pass the door without inquiring after mrs .  bates but i have been so pleasantly detained now however we must wish you and mrs .  bates good morning . and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded . she regained the streethappy in this that though much had been forced on her against her will though she had in fact heard the whole substance of jane fairfaxs letter she had been able to escape the letter itself . chapter ii jane fairfax was an orphan the only child of mrs .  batess youngest daughter . the marriage of lieut . fairfax of the  regiment of infantry and miss jane bates had had its day of fame and pleasure hope and interest but nothing now remained of it save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroadof his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwardsand this girl . by birth she belonged to highbury and when at three years old on losing her mother she became the property the charge the consolation the fondling of her grandmother and aunt there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there of her being taught only what very limited means could command and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person good understanding and warmhearted wellmeaning relations . but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny . this was colonel campbell who had very highly regarded fairfax as an excellent officer and most deserving young man and farther had been indebted to him for such attentions during a severe campfever as he believed had saved his life . these were claims which he did not learn to overlook though some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax before his own return to england put any thing in his power . when he did return he sought out the child and took notice of her . he was a married man with only one living child a girl about janes age and jane became their guest paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all and before she was nine years old his daughters great fondness for her and his own wish of being a real friend united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education . it was accepted and from that period jane had belonged to colonel campbells family and had lived with them entirely only visiting her grandmother from time to time . the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible . to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel campbells power for though his income by pay and appointments was handsome his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughters but by giving her an education he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter . such was jane fairfaxs history . she had fallen into good hands known nothing but kindness from the campbells and been given an excellent education . living constantly with rightminded and wellinformed people her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture and colonel campbells residence being in london every lighter talent had been done full justice to by the attendance of firstrate masters . her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do and at eighteen or nineteen she was as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children fully competent to the office of instruction herself but she was too much beloved to be parted with . neither father nor mother could promote and the daughter could not endure it . the evil day was put off . it was easy to decide that she was still too young and jane remained with them sharing as another daughter in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society and a judicious mixture of home and amusement with only the drawback of the future the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over . the affection of the whole family the warm attachment of miss campbell in particular was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of janes decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements . that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents . they continued together with unabated regard however till the marriage of miss campbell who by that chance that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior engaged the affections of mr .  dixon a young man rich and agreeable almost as soon as they were acquainted and was eligibly and happily settled while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn . this event had very lately taken place too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning . she had long resolved that oneandtwenty should be the period . with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate she had resolved at oneandtwenty to complete the sacrifice and retire from all the pleasures of life of rational intercourse equal society peace and hope to penance and mortification for ever . the good sense of colonel and mrs .  campbell could not oppose such a resolution though their feelings did . as long as they lived no exertions would be necessary their home might be hers for ever and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly but this would be selfishnesswhat must be at last had better be soon . perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished . still however affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment . she had never been quite well since the time of their daughters marriage and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength they must forbid her engaging in duties which so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits seemed under the most favourable circumstances to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort . with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth though there might be some truths not told . it was her own choice to give the time of their absence to highbury to spend perhaps her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear and the campbells whatever might be their motive or motives whether single or double or treble gave the arrangement their ready sanction and said that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air for the recovery of her health than on any thing else . certain it was that she was to come and that highbury instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised itmr . frank churchillmust put up for the present with jane fairfax who could bring only the freshness of a two years absence . emma was sorryto have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long monthsto be always doing more than she wished and less than she ought why she did not like jane fairfax might be a difficult question to answer mr .  knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman which she wanted to be thought herself and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time there were moments of selfexamination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her . but she could never get acquainted with her she did not know how it was but there was such coldness and reserve such apparent indifference whether she pleased or notand then her aunt was such an eternal talkerand she was made such a fuss with by every bodyand it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimatebecause their ages were the same every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other . these were her reasons she had no better . it was a dislike so little justevery imputed fault was so magnified by fancy that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any considerable absence without feeling that she had injured her and now when the due visit was paid on her arrival after a two years interval she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners which for those two whole years she had been depreciating . jane fairfax was very elegant remarkably elegant and she had herself the highest value for elegance . her height was pretty just such as almost every body would think tall and nobody could think very tall her figure particularly graceful her size a most becoming medium between fat and thin though a slight appearance of illhealth seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two . emma could not but feel all this and then her faceher features there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered it was not regular but it was very pleasing beauty . her eyes a deep grey with dark eyelashes and eyebrows had never been denied their praise but the skin which she had been used to cavil at as wanting colour had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom . it was a style of beauty of which elegance was the reigning character and as such she must in honour by all her principles admire itelegance which whether of person or of mind she saw so little in highbury . there not to be vulgar was distinction and merit . in short she sat during the first visit looking at jane fairfax with twofold complacency the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice and was determining that she would dislike her no longer . when she took in her history indeed her situation as well as her beauty when she considered what all this elegance was destined to what she was going to sink from how she was going to live it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect especially if to every wellknown particular entitling her to interest were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to mr .  dixon which she had so naturally started to herself . in that case nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on . emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced mr .  dixons actions from his wife or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first . if it were love it might be simple single successless love on her side alone . she might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison while a sharer of his conversation with her friend and from the best the purest of motives might now be denying herself this visit to ireland and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty . upon the whole emma left her with such softened charitable feelings as made her look around in walking home and lament that highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her . these were charming feelingsbut not lasting . before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for jane fairfax or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors than saying to mr .  knightley she certainly is handsome she is better than handsome jane had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother and aunt and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state . former provocations reappeared . the aunt was as tiresome as ever more tiresome because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast and how small a slice of mutton for dinner as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself and janes offences rose again . they had music emma was obliged to play and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour an air of greatness meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance . she was besides which was the worst of all so cold so cautious there was no getting at her real opinion . wrapt up in a cloak of politeness she seemed determined to hazard nothing . she was disgustingly was suspiciously reserved . if any thing could be more where all was most she was more reserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing . she seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr .  dixons character or her own value for his company or opinion of the suitableness of the match . it was all general approbation and smoothness nothing delineated or distinguished . it did her no service however . her caution was thrown away . emma saw its artifice and returned to her first surmises . there probably was something more to conceal than her own preference mr .  dixon perhaps had been very near changing one friend for the other or been fixed only to miss campbell for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds . the like reserve prevailed on other topics . she and mr .  frank churchill had been at weymouth at the same time . it was known that they were a little acquainted but not a syllable of real information could emma procure as to what he truly was . was he handsomeshe believed he was reckoned a very fine young man . was he agreeable he was generally thought so . did he appear a sensible young man a young man of informationat a wateringplace or in a common london acquaintance it was difficult to decide on such points . manners were all that could be safely judged of under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of mr .  churchill . she believed every body found his manners pleasing . emma could not forgive her . chapter iii emma could not forgive herbut as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by mr .  knightley who had been of the party and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side he was expressing the next morning being at hartfield again on business with mr .  woodhouse his approbation of the whole not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma . he had been used to think her unjust to jane and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement . a very pleasant evening he began as soon as mr .  woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary told that he understood and the papers swept awayparticularly pleasant . you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music . i do not know a more luxurious state sir than sitting at ones ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation . i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant emma . you left nothing undone . i was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument at her grandmothers it must have been a real indulgence . i am happy you approved said emma smiling but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield . no my dear said her father instantly that i am sure you are not . there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are . if any thing you are too attentive . the muffin last nightif it had been handed round once i think it would have been enough . no said mr .  knightley nearly at the same time you are not often deficient not often deficient either in manner or comprehension . i think you understand me therefore . an arch look expressedi understand you well enough but she said only miss fairfax is reserved . i always told you she wasa little but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome all that has its foundation in diffidence . what arises from discretion must be honoured . you think her diffident . i do not see it . my dear emma said he moving from his chair into one close by her you are not going to tell me i hope that you had not a pleasant evening . oh no i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions and amused to think how little information i obtained . i am disappointed was his only answer . i hope every body had a pleasant evening said mr .  woodhouse in his quiet way . i had . once i felt the fire rather too much but then i moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me . miss bates was very chatty and goodhumoured as she always is though she speaks rather too quick . however she is very agreeable and mrs .  bates too in a different way . i like old friends and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a very wellbehaved young lady indeed . she must have found the evening agreeable mr .  knightley because she had emma . true sir and emma because she had miss fairfax . emma saw his anxiety and wishing to appease it at least for the present said and with a sincerity which no one could question she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep ones eyes from . i am always watching her to admire and i do pity her from my heart . mr .  knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express and before he could make any reply mr .  woodhouse whose thoughts were on the batess said it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined a great pity indeed and i have often wishedbut it is so little one can venture to dosmall trifling presents of any thing uncommon now we have killed a porker and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg it is very small and delicatehartfield pork is not like any other porkbut still it is porkand my dear emma unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried as ours are fried without the smallest grease and not roast it for no stomach can bear roast porki think we had better send the leg do not you think so my dear my dear papa i sent the whole hindquarter . i knew you would wish it . there will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like . thats right my dear very right . i had not thought of it before but that is the best way . they must not oversalt the leg and then if it is not oversalted and if it is very thoroughly boiled just as serle boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a boiled turnip and a little carrot or parsnip i do not consider it unwholesome . emma said mr .  knightley presently i have a piece of news for you . you like newsand i heard an article in my way hither that i think will interest you . news oh yes i always like news . what is itwhy do you smile sowhere did you hear itat randalls he had time only to say no not at randalls i have not been near randalls when the door was thrown open and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room . full of thanks and full of news miss bates knew not which to give quickest . mr .  knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him . oh my dear sir how are you this morning my dear miss woodhouse i come quite overpowered . such a beautiful hindquarter of pork you are too bountiful have you heard the news mr .  elton is going to be married . emma had not had time even to think of mr .  elton and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start and a little blush at the sound . there is my newsi thought it would interest you said mr .  knightley with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them . but where could you hear it cried miss bates . where could you possibly hear it mr .  knightley for it is not five minutes since i received mrs .  coles noteno it cannot be more than five or at least tenfor i had got my bonnet and spencer on just ready to come outi was only gone down to speak to patty again about the porkjane was standing in the passagewere not you jane for my mother was so afraid that we had not any saltingpan large enough . so i said i would go down and see and jane said shall i go down instead for i think you have a little cold and patty has been washing the kitchen . oh my dear said iwell and just then came the note . a miss hawkins thats all i know . a miss hawkins of bath . but mr .  knightley how could you possibly have heard it for the very moment mr .  cole told mrs .  cole of it she sat down and wrote to me . a miss hawkins i was with mr .  cole on business an hour and a half ago . he had just read eltons letter as i was shewn in and handed it to me directly . well that is quitei suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting . my dear sir you really are too bountiful . my mother desires her very best compliments and regards and a thousand thanks and says you really quite oppress her . we consider our hartfield pork replied mr .  woodhouseindeed it certainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i cannot have a greater pleasure than oh my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good to us . if ever there were people who without having great wealth themselves had every thing they could wish for i am sure it is us . we may well say that our lot is cast in a goodly heritage . well mr .  knightley and so you actually saw the letter well it was shortmerely to announcebut cheerful exulting of course . here was a sly glance at emma . he had been so fortunate as to i forget the precise wordsone has no business to remember them . the information was as you state that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins . by his style i should imagine it just settled . mr .  elton going to be married said emma as soon as she could speak . he will have every bodys wishes for his happiness . he is very young to settle was mr .  woodhouses observation . he had better not be in a hurry . he seemed to me very well off as he was . we were always glad to see him at hartfield . a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse said miss bates joyfully my mother is so pleasedshe says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress . this is great news indeed . jane you have never seen mr .  eltonno wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him . janes curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her . noi have never seen mr .  elton she replied starting on this appeal is heis he a tall man who shall answer that question cried emma . my father would say yes mr .  knightley no and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium . when you have been here a little longer miss fairfax you will understand that mr .  elton is the standard of perfection in highbury both in person and mind . very true miss woodhouse so she will . he is the very best young manbut my dear jane if you remember i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr .  perry . miss hawkinsi dare say an excellent young woman . his extreme attention to my mother wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better for my mother is a little deaf you knowit is not much but she does not hear quite quick . jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf . he fancied bathing might be good for itthe warm bath but she says it did him no lasting benefit . colonel campbell you know is quite our angel . and mr .  dixon seems a very charming young man quite worthy of him . it is such a happiness when good people get togetherand they always do . now here will be mr .  elton and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people and the perrysi suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr .  and mrs .  perry . i say sir turning to mr .  woodhouse i think there are few places with such society as highbury . i always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours . my dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork a roast loin of pork as to who or what miss hawkins is or how long he has been acquainted with her said emma nothing i suppose can be known . one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance . he has been gone only four weeks . nobody had any information to give and after a few more wonderings emma said you are silent miss fairfaxbut i hope you mean to take an interest in this news . you who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep in the business on miss campbells accountwe shall not excuse your being indifferent about mr .  elton and miss hawkins . when i have seen mr .  elton replied jane i dare say i shall be interestedbut i believe it requires that with me . and as it is some months since miss campbell married the impression may be a little worn off . yes he has been gone just four weeks as you observe miss woodhouse said miss bates four weeks yesterday . a miss hawkinswell i had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts not that i evermrs . cole once whispered to mebut i immediately said no mr .  elton is a most worthy young manbutin short i do not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries . i do not pretend to it . what is before me i see . at the same time nobody could wonder if mr .  elton should have aspiredmiss woodhouse lets me chatter on so goodhumouredly . she knows i would not offend for the world . how does miss smith do she seems quite recovered now . have you heard from mrs .  john knightley lately oh those dear little children . jane do you know i always fancy mr .  dixon like mr .  john knightley . i mean in persontall and with that sort of lookand not very talkative . quite wrong my dear aunt there is no likeness at all . very odd but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand . one takes up a notion and runs away with it . mr .  dixon you say is not strictly speaking handsome handsome oh nofar from itcertainly plain . i told you he was plain . my dear you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain and that you yourself oh as for me my judgment is worth nothing . where i have a regard i always think a person welllooking . but i gave what i believed the general opinion when i called him plain . well my dear jane i believe we must be running away . the weather does not look well and grandmama will be uneasy . you are too obliging my dear miss woodhouse but we really must take leave . this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed . i shall just go round by mrs .  coles but i shall not stop three minutes and jane you had better go home directlyi would not have you out in a showerwe think she is the better for highbury already . thank you we do indeed . i shall not attempt calling on mrs .  goddard for i really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork when we dress the leg it will be another thing . good morning to you my dear sir . oh mr .  knightley is coming too . well that is so veryi am sure if jane is tired you will be so kind as to give her your arm . mr . elton and miss hawkinsgood morning to you . emma alone with her father had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry and to marry strangers tooand the other half she could give to her own view of the subject . it was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news as proving that mr .  elton could not have suffered long but she was sorry for harriet harriet must feel itand all that she could hope was by giving the first information herself to save her from hearing it abruptly from others . it was now about the time that she was likely to call . if she were to meet miss bates in her wayand upon its beginning to rain emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at mrs .  goddards and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation . the shower was heavy but short and it had not been over five minutes when in came harriet with just the heated agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give and the oh miss woodhouse what do you think has happened which instantly burst forth had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation . as the blow was given emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening and harriet unchecked ran eagerly through what she had to tell . she had set out from mrs .  goddards half an hour agoshe had been afraid it would rainshe had been afraid it would pour down every momentbut she thought she might get to hartfield firstshe had hurried on as fast as possible but then as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her she thought she would just step in and see how it went on and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there soon after she came out it began to rain and she did not know what to do so she ran on directly as fast as she could and took shelter at fords . fords was the principal woollendraper linendraper and haberdashers shop united the shop first in size and fashion in the place . and so there she had set without an idea of any thing in the world full ten minutes perhapswhen all of a sudden who should come in to be sure it was so very oddbut they always dealt at fords who should come in but elizabeth martin and her brother dear miss woodhouse only think . i thought i should have fainted . i did not know what to do . i was sitting near the doorelizabeth saw me directly but he did not he was busy with the umbrella . i am sure she saw me but she looked away directly and took no notice and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop and i kept sitting near the dooroh dear i was so miserable i am sure i must have been as white as my gown . i could not go away you know because of the rain but i did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there . oh dear miss woodhousewell at last i fancy he looked round and saw me for instead of going on with her buyings they began whispering to one another . i am sure they were talking of me and i could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to medo you think he was miss woodhousefor presently she came forwardcame quite up to me and asked me how i did and seemed ready to shake hands if i would . she did not do any of it in the same way that she used i could see she was altered but however she seemed to try to be very friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time but i know no more what i saidi was in such a tremblei remember she said she was sorry we never met now which i thought almost too kind dear miss woodhouse i was absolutely miserable by that time it was beginning to hold up and i was determined that nothing should stop me from getting awayand thenonly think i found he was coming up towards me tooslowly you know and as if he did not quite know what to do and so he came and spoke and i answeredand i stood for a minute feeling dreadfully you know one cant tell how and then i took courage and said it did not rain and i must go and so off i set and i had not got three yards from the door when he came after me only to say if i was going to hartfield he thought i had much better go round by mr .  coles stables for i should find the near way quite floated by this rain . oh dear i thought it would have been the death of me so i said i was very much obliged to him you know i could not do less and then he went back to elizabeth and i came round by the stablesi believe i didbut i hardly knew where i was or any thing about it . oh miss woodhouse i would rather done any thing than have it happen and yet you know there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly . and elizabeth too . oh miss woodhouse do talk to me and make me comfortable again . very sincerely did emma wish to do so but it was not immediately in her power . she was obliged to stop and think . she was not thoroughly comfortable herself . the young mans conduct and his sisters seemed the result of real feeling and she could not but pity them . as harriet described it there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour . but she had believed them to be wellmeaning worthy people before and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion it was folly to be disturbed by it . of course he must be sorry to lose herthey must be all sorry . ambition as well as love had probably been mortified . they might all have hoped to rise by harriets acquaintance and besides what was the value of harriets descriptionso easily pleasedso little discerning what signified her praise she exerted herself and did try to make her comfortable by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle and quite unworthy of being dwelt on it might be distressing for the moment said she but you seem to have behaved extremely well and it is overand may never can never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about it . harriet said very true and she would not think about it but still she talked of itstill she could talk of nothing else and emma at last in order to put the martins out of her head was obliged to hurry on the news which she had meant to give with so much tender caution hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry ashamed or only amused at such a state of mind in poor harrietsuch a conclusion of mr .  eltons importance with her mr .  eltons rights however gradually revived . though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before or an hour before its interest soon increased and before their first conversation was over she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity wonder and regret pain and pleasure as to this fortunate miss hawkins which could conduce to place the martins under proper subordination in her fancy . emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting . it had been serviceable in deadening the first shock without retaining any influence to alarm . as harriet now lived the martins could not get at her without seeking her where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her for since her refusal of the brother the sisters never had been at mrs .  goddards and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again with any necessity or even any power of speech . chapter iv human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations that a young person who either marries or dies is sure of being kindly spoken of . a week had not passed since miss hawkinss name was first mentioned in highbury before she was by some means or other discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind to be handsome elegant highly accomplished and perfectly amiable and when mr .  elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects and circulate the fame of her merits there was very little more for him to do than to tell her christian name and say whose music she principally played . mr .  elton returned a very happy man . he had gone away rejected and mortifieddisappointed in a very sanguine hope after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement and not only losing the right lady but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one . he had gone away deeply offendedhe came back engaged to anotherand to another as superior of course to the first as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost . he came back gay and selfsatisfied eager and busy caring nothing for miss woodhouse and defying miss smith . the charming augusta hawkins in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit was in possession of an independent fortune of so many thousands as would always be called ten a point of some dignity as well as some convenience the story told well he had not thrown himself awayhe had gained a woman of 10000 l .  or thereabouts and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice the history which he had to give mrs .  cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so gloriousthe steps so quick from the accidental rencontre to the dinner at mr .  greens and the party at mrs .  brownssmiles and blushes rising in importance with consciousness and agitation richly scatteredthe lady had been so easily impressedso sweetly disposedhad in short to use a most intelligible phrase been so very ready to have him that vanity and prudence were equally contented . he had caught both substance and shadowboth fortune and affection and was just the happy man he ought to be talking only of himself and his own concernsexpecting to be congratulatedready to be laughed atand with cordial fearless smiles now addressing all the young ladies of the place to whom a few weeks ago he would have been more cautiously gallant . the wedding was no distant event as the parties had only themselves to please and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for and when he set out for bath again there was a general expectation which a certain glance of mrs .  coles did not seem to contradict that when he next entered highbury he would bring his bride . during his present short stay emma had barely seen him but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension now spread over his air . she was in fact beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings that except in a moral light as a penance a lesson a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again . she wished him very well but he gave her pain and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction . the pain of his continued residence in highbury however must certainly be lessened by his marriage . many vain solicitudes would be prevented many awkwardnesses smoothed by it . a mrs .  elton would be an excuse for any change of intercourse former intimacy might sink without remark . it would be almost beginning their life of civility again . of the lady individually emma thought very little . she was good enough for mr .  elton no doubt accomplished enough for highbury handsome enoughto look plain probably by harriets side . as to connexion there emma was perfectly easy persuaded that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet he had done nothing . on that article truth seemed attainable . what she was must be uncertain but who she was might be found out and setting aside the 10000 l .  it did not appear that she was at all harriets superior . she brought no name no blood no alliance . miss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a bristol merchant of course he must be called but as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also . part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath but bristol was her home the very heart of bristol for though the father and mother had died some years ago an uncle remained in the law linenothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him than that he was in the law line and with him the daughter had lived . emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney and too stupid to rise . and all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister who was very well married to a gentleman in a great way near bristol who kept two carriages that was the windup of the history that was the glory of miss hawkins . could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all she had talked her into love but alas she was not so easily to be talked out of it . the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harriets mind was not to be talked away . he might be superseded by another he certainly would indeed nothing could be clearer even a robert martin would have been sufficient but nothing else she feared would cure her . harriet was one of those who having once begun would be always in love . and now poor girl she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr .  elton . she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other . emma saw him only once but two or three times every day harriet was sure just to meet with him or just to miss him just to hear his voice or see his shoulder just to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture . she was moreover perpetually hearing about him for excepting when at hartfield she was always among those who saw no fault in mr .  elton and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns and every report therefore every guessall that had already occurred all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs comprehending income servants and furniture was continually in agitation around her . her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him and her regrets kept alive and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss hawkinss happiness and continual observation of how much he seemed attached his air as he walked by the housethe very sitting of his hat being all in proof of how much he was in love had it been allowable entertainment had there been no pain to her friend or reproach to herself in the waverings of harriets mind emma would have been amused by its variations . sometimes mr .  elton predominated sometimes the martins and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other . mr .  eltons engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr .  martin . the unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by elizabeth martins calling at mrs .  goddards a few days afterwards . harriet had not been at home but a note had been prepared and left for her written in the very style to touch a small mixture of reproach with a great deal of kindness and till mr .  elton himself appeared she had been much occupied by it continually pondering over what could be done in return and wishing to do more than she dared to confess . but mr .  elton in person had driven away all such cares . while he staid the martins were forgotten and on the very morning of his setting off for bath again emma to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned judged it best for her to return elizabeth martins visit . how that visit was to be acknowledgedwhat would be necessary and what might be safest had been a point of some doubtful consideration . absolute neglect of the mother and sisters when invited to come would be ingratitude . it must not be and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance after much thinking she could determine on nothing better than harriets returning the visit but in a way that if they had understanding should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance . she meant to take her in the carriage leave her at the abbey mill while she drove a little farther and call for her again so soon as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future . she could think of nothing better and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approvesomething of ingratitude merely glossed overit must be done or what would become of harriet chapter v small heart had harriet for visiting . only half an hour before her friend called for her at mrs .  goddards her evil stars had led her to the very spot where at that moment a trunk directed to the rev . philip elton whitehart bath was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butchers cart which was to convey it to where the coaches past and every thing in this world excepting that trunk and the direction was consequently a blank . she went however and when they reached the farm and she was to be put down at the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led between espalier appletrees to the front door the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before was beginning to revive a little local agitation and when they parted emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour . she went on herself to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married and settled in donwell . the quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again and miss smith receiving her summons was with her without delay and unattended by any alarming young man . she came solitarily down the gravel walka miss martin just appearing at the door and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility . harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account . she was feeling too much but at last emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting and the sort of pain it was creating . she had seen only mrs .  martin and the two girls . they had received her doubtingly if not coolly and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time till just at last when mrs .  martins saying all of a sudden that she thought miss smith was grown had brought on a more interesting subject and a warmer manner . in that very room she had been measured last september with her two friends . there were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window . he had done it . they all seemed to remember the day the hour the party the occasionto feel the same consciousness the same regretsto be ready to return to the same good understanding and they were just growing again like themselves harriet as emma must suspect as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy when the carriage reappeared and all was over . the style of the visit and the shortness of it were then felt to be decisive . fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months agoemma could not but picture it all and feel how justly they might resent how naturally harriet must suffer . it was a bad business . she would have given a great deal or endured a great deal to have had the martins in a higher rank of life . they were so deserving that a little higher should have been enough but as it was how could she have done otherwiseimpossibleshe could not repent . they must be separated but there was a great deal of pain in the process so much to herself at this time that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation and resolved on going home by way of randalls to procure it . her mind was quite sick of mr .  elton and the martins . the refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary . it was a good scheme but on driving to the door they heard that neither master nor mistress was at home they had both been out some time the man believed they were gone to hartfield . this is too bad cried emma as they turned away . and now we shall just miss them too provokingi do not know when i have been so disappointed . and she leaned back in the corner to indulge her murmurs or to reason them away probably a little of both such being the commonest process of a not illdisposed mind . presently the carriage stopt she looked up it was stopt by mr .  and mrs .  weston who were standing to speak to her . there was instant pleasure in the sight of them and still greater pleasure was conveyed in soundfor mr .  weston immediately accosted her with how dye dohow dye dowe have been sitting with your father glad to see him so well . frank comes tomorrowi had a letter this morningwe see him tomorrow by dinnertime to a certainty he is at oxford today and he comes for a whole fortnight i knew it would be so . if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three days i was always glad he did not come at christmas now we are going to have just the right weather for him fine dry settled weather . we shall enjoy him completely every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish . there was no resisting such news no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as mr .  westons confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife fewer and quieter but not less to the purpose . to know that she thought his coming certain was enough to make emma consider it so and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy . it was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits . the wornout past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming and in the rapidity of half a moments thought she hoped mr .  elton would now be talked of no more . mr .  weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command as well as the route and the method of his journey and she listened and smiled and congratulated . i shall soon bring him over to hartfield said he at the conclusion . emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech from his wife . we had better move on mr .  weston said she we are detaining the girls . well well i am readyand turning again to emma but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man you have only had my account you know i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction . emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing . think of me tomorrow my dear emma about four oclock was mrs .  westons parting injunction spoken with some anxiety and meant only for her . four oclockdepend upon it he will be here by three was mr .  westons quick amendment and so ended a most satisfactory meeting . emmas spirits were mounted quite up to happiness every thing wore a different air james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before . when she looked at the hedges she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out and when she turned round to harriet she saw something like a look of spring a tender smile even there . will mr .  frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford was a question however which did not augur much . but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once and emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time . the morning of the interesting day arrived and mrs .  westons faithful pupil did not forget either at ten or eleven or twelve oclock that she was to think of her at four . my dear dear anxious friendsaid she in mental soliloquy while walking downstairs from her own room always overcareful for every bodys comfort but your own i see you now in all your little fidgets going again and again into his room to be sure that all is right . the clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall . tis twelve i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence and by this time tomorrow perhaps or a little later i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here . i am sure they will bring him soon . she opened the parlour door and saw two gentlemen sitting with her fathermr . weston and his son . they had been arrived only a few minutes and mr .  weston had scarcely finished his explanation of franks being a day before his time and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations when she appeared to have her share of surprize introduction and pleasure . the frank churchill so long talked of so high in interest was actually before herhe was presented to her and she did not think too much had been said in his praise he was a very good looking young man height air address all were unexceptionable and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his fathers he looked quick and sensible . she felt immediately that she should like him and there was a wellbred ease of manner and a readiness to talk which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her and that acquainted they soon must be . he had reached randalls the evening before . she was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan and travel earlier later and quicker that he might gain half a day . i told you yesterday cried mr .  weston with exultation i told you all that he would be here before the time named . i remembered what i used to do myself . one cannot creep upon a journey one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned and the pleasure of coming in upon ones friends before the lookout begins is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs . it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it said the young man though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far but in coming home i felt i might do any thing . the word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency . emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable the conviction was strengthened by what followed . he was very much pleased with randalls thought it a most admirably arranged house would hardly allow it even to be very small admired the situation the walk to highbury highbury itself hartfield still more and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but ones own country gives and the greatest curiosity to visit it . that he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before passed suspiciously through emmas brain but still if it were a falsehood it was a pleasant one and pleasantly handled . his manner had no air of study or exaggeration . he did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment . their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance . on his side were the inquirieswas she a horsewomanpleasant rides pleasant walkshad they a large neighbourhoodhighbury perhaps afforded society enoughthere were several very pretty houses in and about it . ballshad they ballswas it a musical society but when satisfied on all these points and their acquaintance proportionably advanced he contrived to find an opportunity while their two fathers were engaged with each other of introducing his motherinlaw and speaking of her with so much handsome praise so much warm admiration so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father and her very kind reception of himself as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her . he did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by mrs .  weston but undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter . he understood what would be welcome he could be sure of little else . his fathers marriage he said had been the wisest measure every friend must rejoice in it and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him . he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylors merits without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouses character than miss woodhouse miss taylors . and at last as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person . elegant agreeable manners i was prepared for said he but i confess that considering every thing i had not expected more than a very tolerably welllooking woman of a certain age i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs .  weston . you cannot see too much perfection in mrs .  weston for my feelings said emma were you to guess her to be eighteen i should listen with pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words . dont let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman . i hope i should know better he replied no depend upon it with a gallant bow that in addressing mrs .  weston i should understand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms . emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other which had taken strong possession of her mind had ever crossed his and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence or proofs of defiance . she must see more of him to understand his ways at present she only felt they were agreeable . she had no doubt of what mr .  weston was often thinking about . his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression and even when he might have determined not to look she was confident that he was often listening . her own fathers perfect exemption from any thought of the kind the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion was a most comfortable circumstance . happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it . though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them . she blessed the favouring blindness . he could now without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest give way to all his natural kindhearted civility in solicitous inquiries after mr .  frank churchills accommodation on his journey through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching coldwhich however he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night . a reasonable visit paid mr .  weston began to move . he must be going . he had business at the crown about his hay and a great many errands for mrs .  weston at fords but he need not hurry any body else . his son too well bred to hear the hint rose immediately also saying as you are going farther on business sir i will take the opportunity of paying a visit which must be paid some day or other and therefore may as well be paid now . i have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours turning to emma a lady residing in or near highbury a family of the name of fairfax . i shall have no difficulty i suppose in finding the house though fairfax i believe is not the proper namei should rather say barnes or bates . do you know any family of that name to be sure we do cried his father mrs .  bateswe passed her house i saw miss bates at the window . true true you are acquainted with miss fairfax i remember you knew her at weymouth and a fine girl she is . call upon her by all means . there is no necessity for my calling this morning said the young man another day would do as well but there was that degree of acquaintance at weymouth which oh go today go today . do not defer it . what is right to be done cannot be done too soon . and besides i must give you a hint frank any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided . you saw her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body she mixed with but here she is with a poor old grandmother who has barely enough to live on . if you do not call early it will be a slight . the son looked convinced . i have heard her speak of the acquaintance said emma she is a very elegant young woman . he agreed to it but with so quiet a yes as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world if jane fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it . if you were never particularly struck by her manners before said she i think you will today . you will see her to advantage see her and hear herno i am afraid you will not hear her at all for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue . you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir are you said mr .  woodhouse always the last to make his way in conversation then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady . she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt very worthy people i have known them all my life . they will be extremely glad to see you i am sure and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way . my dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me . but your father is not going so far he is only going to the crown quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk unless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street . mr .  frank churchill still declined it looking as serious as he could and his father gave his hearty support by calling out my good friend this is quite unnecessary frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it and as to mrs .  batess he may get there from the crown in a hop step and jump . they were permitted to go alone and with a cordial nod from one and a graceful bow from the other the two gentlemen took leave . emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of the day with full confidence in their comfort . chapter vi the next morning brought mr .  frank churchill again . he came with mrs .  weston to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially . he had been sitting with her it appeared most companionably at home till her usual hour of exercise and on being desired to chuse their walk immediately fixed on highbury . he did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction but if left to him he should always chuse the same . highbury that airy cheerful happylooking highbury would be his constant attraction . highbury with mrs .  weston stood for hartfield and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him . they walked thither directly . emma had hardly expected them for mr .  weston who had called in for half a minute in order to hear that his son was very handsome knew nothing of their plans and it was an agreeable surprize to her therefore to perceive them walking up to the house together arm in arm . she was wanting to see him again and especially to see him in company with mrs .  weston upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend . if he were deficient there nothing should make amends for it . but on seeing them together she became perfectly satisfied . it was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to hernothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection . and there was time enough for emma to form a reasonable judgment as their visit included all the rest of the morning . they were all three walking about together for an hour or two first round the shrubberies of hartfield and afterwards in highbury . he was delighted with every thing admired hartfield sufficiently for mr .  woodhouses ear and when their going farther was resolved on confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma could have supposed . some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings . he begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long and which had been the home of his fathers father and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit they shewed altogether a goodwill towards highbury in general which must be very like a merit to those he was with . emma watched and decided that with such feelings as were now shewn it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself that he had not been acting a part or making a parade of insincere professions and that mr .  knightley certainly had not done him justice . their first pause was at the crown inn an inconsiderable house though the principal one of the sort where a couple of pair of posthorses were kept more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added it had been built many years ago for a ballroom and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous dancing state had been occasionally used as suchbut such brilliant days had long passed away and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and halfgentlemen of the place . he was immediately interested . its character as a ballroom caught him and instead of passing on he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open to look in and contemplate its capabilities and lament that its original purpose should have ceased . he saw no fault in the room he would acknowledge none which they suggested . no it was long enough broad enough handsome enough . it would hold the very number for comfort . they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter . why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good old days of the roomshe who could do any thing in highbury the want of proper families in the place and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend were mentioned but he was not satisfied . he could not be persuaded that so many goodlooking houses as he saw around him could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting and even when particulars were given and families described he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every bodys returning into their proper place the next morning . he argued like a young man very much bent on dancing and emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the churchills . he seemed to have all the life and spirit cheerful feelings and social inclinations of his father and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe . of pride indeed there was perhaps scarcely enough his indifference to a confusion of rank bordered too much on inelegance of mind . he could be no judge however of the evil he was holding cheap . it was but an effusion of lively spirits . at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown and being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged emma recollected his intended visit the day before and asked him if he had paid it . yes oh yeshe replied i was just going to mention it . a very successful visiti saw all the three ladies and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint . if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me . as it was i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit . ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before himbut there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly threequarters of an hour . the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before . and how did you think miss fairfax looking ill very illthat is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill .  but the expression is hardly admissible mrs .  weston is it ladies can never look ill .  and seriously miss fairfax is naturally so pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health . a most deplorable want of complexion . emma would not agree to this and began a warm defence of miss fairfaxs complexion . it was certainly never brilliant but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face . he listened with all due deference acknowledged that he had heard many people say the samebut yet he must confess that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health . where features were indifferent a fine complexion gave beauty to them all and where they were good the effect wasfortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was . well said emma there is no disputing about taste . at least you admire her except her complexion . he shook his head and laughed . i cannot separate miss fairfax and her complexion . did you see her often at weymouth were you often in the same society at this moment they were approaching fords and he hastily exclaimed ha this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives as my father informs me . he comes to highbury himself he says six days out of the seven and has always business at fords . if it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in that i may prove myself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of highbury . i must buy something at fords . it will be taking out my freedom . i dare say they sell gloves . oh yes gloves and every thing . i do admire your patriotism . you will be adored in highbury . you were very popular before you came because you were mr .  westons sonbut lay out half a guinea at fords and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues . they went in and while the sleek welltied parcels of mens beavers and york tan were bringing down and displaying on the counter he saidbut i beg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae . do not let me lose it . i assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life . i merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth . and now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a very unfair one . it is always the ladys right to decide on the degree of acquaintance . miss fairfax must already have given her account . i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow . upon my word you answer as discreetly as she could do herself . but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed she is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least information about any body that i really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her . may i indeedthen i will speak the truth and nothing suits me so well . i met her frequently at weymouth . i had known the campbells a little in town and at weymouth we were very much in the same set . colonel campbell is a very agreeable man and mrs .  campbell a friendly warmhearted woman . i like them all . you know miss fairfaxs situation in life i conclude what she is destined to be yesrather hesitatinglyi believe i do . you get upon delicate subjects emma said mrs .  weston smiling remember that i am here . mr . frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfaxs situation in life . i will move a little farther off . i certainly do forget to think of her said emma as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend . he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment . when the gloves were bought and they had quitted the shop again did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play said frank churchill . ever hear her repeated emma . you forget how much she belongs to highbury . i have heard her every year of our lives since we both began . she plays charmingly . you think so do youi wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge . she appeared to me to play well that is with considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myself . i am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any bodys performance . i have been used to hear hers admired and i remember one proof of her being thought to play wella man a very musical man and in love with another womanengaged to heron the point of marriage would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument if the lady in question could sit down insteadnever seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other . that i thought in a man of known musical talent was some proof . proof indeed said emma highly amused . mr . dixon is very musical is he we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year . yes mr .  dixon and miss campbell were the persons and i thought it a very strong proof . certainlyvery strong it was to own the truth a great deal stronger than if i had been miss campbell would have been at all agreeable to me . i could not excuse a mans having more music than lovemore ear than eyea more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings . how did miss campbell appear to like it it was her very particular friend you know . poor comfort said emma laughing . one would rather have a stranger preferred than ones very particular friendwith a stranger it might not recur againbut the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself poor mrs .  dixon well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland . you are right . it was not very flattering to miss campbell but she really did not seem to feel it . so much the betteror so much the worsei do not know which . but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in herquickness of friendship or dulness of feelingthere was one person i think who must have felt it miss fairfax herself . she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction . as to thati do not oh do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfaxs sensations from you or from any body else . they are known to no human being i guess but herself . but if she continued to play whenever she was asked by mr .  dixon one may guess what one chuses . there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all he began rather quickly but checking himself added however it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were how it might all be behind the scenes . i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly . but you who have known miss fairfax from a child must be a better judge of her character and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations than i can be . i have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children and women together and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimatethat we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends . but we never did . i hardly know how it has happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother and all their set . and then her reservei never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved . it is a most repulsive quality indeed said he . oftentimes very convenient no doubt but never pleasing . there is safety in reserve but no attraction . one cannot love a reserved person . not till the reserve ceases towards oneself and then the attraction may be the greater . but i must be more in want of a friend or an agreeable companion than i have yet been to take the trouble of conquering any bodys reserve to procure one . intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question . i have no reason to think ill of hernot the leastexcept that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal . he perfectly agreed with her and after walking together so long and thinking so much alike emma felt herself so well acquainted with him that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting . he was not exactly what she had expected less of the man of the world in some of his notions less of the spoiled child of fortune therefore better than she had expected . his ideas seemed more moderate his feelings warmer . she was particularly struck by his manner of considering mr .  eltons house which as well as the church he would go and look at and would not join them in finding much fault with . no he could not believe it a bad house not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having . if it were to be shared with the woman he loved he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house . there must be ample room in it for every real comfort . the man must be a blockhead who wanted more . mrs .  weston laughed and said he did not know what he was talking about . used only to a large house himself and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one . but emma in her own mind determined that he did know what he was talking about and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life and to marry from worthy motives . he might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeepers room or a bad butlers pantry but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make him happy and that whenever he were attached he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment . chapter vii emmas very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken the following day by hearing that he was gone off to london merely to have his hair cut . a sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast and he had sent for a chaise and set off intending to return to dinner but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut . there was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve . it did not accord with the rationality of plan the moderation in expense or even the unselfish warmth of heart which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday . vanity extravagance love of change restlessness of temper which must be doing something good or bad heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and mrs .  weston indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general he became liable to all these charges . his father only called him a coxcomb and thought it a very good story but that mrs .  weston did not like it was clear enough by her passing it over as quickly as possible and making no other comment than that all young people would have their little whims . with the exception of this little blot emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him . mrs .  weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himselfhow much she saw to like in his disposition altogether . he appeared to have a very open tempercertainly a very cheerful and lively one she could observe nothing wrong in his notions a great deal decidedly right he spoke of his uncle with warm regard was fond of talking of himsaid he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself and though there was no being attached to the aunt he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect . this was all very promising and but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him the honour if not of being really in love with her of being at least very near it and saved only by her own indifference for still her resolution held of never marryingthe honour in short of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance . mr .  weston on his side added a virtue to the account which must have some weight . he gave her to understand that frank admired her extremelythought her very beautiful and very charming and with so much to be said for him altogether she found she must not judge him harshly . as mrs .  weston observed all young people would have their little whims . there was one person among his new acquaintance in surry not so leniently disposed . in general he was judged throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury with great candour liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man one who smiled so often and bowed so well but there was one spirit among them not to be softened from its power of censure by bows or smilesmr . knightley . the circumstance was told him at hartfield for the moment he was silent but emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself over a newspaper he held in his hand hum just the trifling silly fellow i took him for . she had half a mind to resent but an instants observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings and not meant to provoke and therefore she let it pass . although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings mr .  and mrs .  westons visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune . something occurred while they were at hartfield to make emma want their advice and which was still more lucky she wanted exactly the advice they gave . this was the occurrencethe coles had been settled some years in highbury and were very good sort of peoplefriendly liberal and unpretending but on the other hand they were of low origin in trade and only moderately genteel . on their first coming into the country they had lived in proportion to their income quietly keeping little company and that little unexpensively but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means the house in town had yielded greater profits and fortune in general had smiled on them . with their wealth their views increased their want of a larger house their inclination for more company . they added to their house to their number of servants to their expenses of every sort and by this time were in fortune and style of living second only to the family at hartfield . their love of society and their new diningroom prepared every body for their keeping dinnercompany and a few parties chiefly among the single men had already taken place . the regular and best families emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite neither donwell nor hartfield nor randalls . nothing should tempt her to go if they did and she regretted that her fathers known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish . the coles were very respectable in their way but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them . this lesson she very much feared they would receive only from herself she had little hope of mr .  knightley none of mr .  weston . but she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared that when the insult came at last it found her very differently affected . donwell and randalls had received their invitation and none had come for her father and herself and mrs .  westons accounting for it with i suppose they will not take the liberty with you they know you do not dine out was not quite sufficient . she felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal and afterwards as the idea of the party to be assembled there consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her occurred again and again she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept . harriet was to be there in the evening and the bateses . they had been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence . might not the evening end in a dance had been a question of his . the bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits and her being left in solitary grandeur even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment was but poor comfort . it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at hartfield which made their presence so acceptable for though her first remark on reading it was that of course it must be declined she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful . she owned that considering every thing she was not absolutely without inclination for the party . the coles expressed themselves so properlythere was so much real attention in the manner of it so much consideration for her father . they would have solicited the honour earlier but had been waiting the arrival of a foldingscreen from london which they hoped might keep mr .  woodhouse from any draught of air and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company . upon the whole she was very persuadable and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comforthow certainly mrs .  goddard if not mrs .  bates might be depended on for bearing him company mr .  woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughters going out to dinner on a day now near at hand and spending the whole evening away from him . as for his going emma did not wish him to think it possible the hours would be too late and the party too numerous . he was soon pretty well resigned . i am not fond of dinnervisiting said hei never was . no more is emma . late hours do not agree with us . i am sorry mr .  and mrs .  cole should have done it . i think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer and take their tea with ustake us in their afternoon walk which they might do as our hours are so reasonable and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening . the dews of a summer evening are what i would not expose any body to . however as they are so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them and as you will both be there and mr .  knightley too to take care of her i cannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what it ought neither damp nor cold nor windy . then turning to mrs .  weston with a look of gentle reproachah miss taylor if you had not married you would have staid at home with me . well sir cried mr .  weston as i took miss taylor away it is incumbent on me to supply her place if i can and i will step to mrs .  goddard in a moment if you wish it . but the idea of any thing to be done in a moment was increasing not lessening mr .  woodhouses agitation . the ladies knew better how to allay it . mr .  weston must be quiet and every thing deliberately arranged . with this treatment mr .  woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual . he should be happy to see mrs .  goddard . he had a great regard for mrs .  goddard and emma should write a line and invite her . james could take the note . but first of all there must be an answer written to mrs .  cole . you will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible . you will say that i am quite an invalid and go no where and therefore must decline their obliging invitation beginning with my compliments of course . but you will do every thing right . i need not tell you what is to be done . we must remember to let james know that the carriage will be wanted on tuesday . i shall have no fears for you with him . we have never been there above once since the new approach was made but still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely . and when you get there you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again and you had better name an early hour . you will not like staying late . you will get very tired when tea is over . but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa oh no my love but you will soon be tired . there will be a great many people talking at once . you will not like the noise . but my dear sir cried mr .  weston if emma comes away early it will be breaking up the party . and no great harm if it does said mr .  woodhouse . the sooner every party breaks up the better . but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles . emmas going away directly after tea might be giving offence . they are goodnatured people and think little of their own claims but still they must feel that any bodys hurrying away is no great compliment and miss woodhouses doing it would be more thought of than any other persons in the room . you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles i am sure sir friendly good sort of people as ever lived and who have been your neighbours these ten years . no upon no account in the world mr .  weston i am much obliged to you for reminding me . i should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain . i know what worthy people they are . perry tells me that mr .  cole never touches malt liquor . you would not think it to look at him but he is biliousmr . cole is very bilious . no i would not be the means of giving them any pain . my dear emma we must consider this . i am sure rather than run the risk of hurting mr .  and mrs .  cole you would stay a little longer than you might wish . you will not regard being tired . you will be perfectly safe you know among your friends . oh yes papa . i have no fears at all for myself and i should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs .  weston but on your account . i am only afraid of your sitting up for me . i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs .  goddard . she loves piquet you know but when she is gone home i am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself instead of going to bed at your usual timeand the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort . you must promise me not to sit up . he did on the condition of some promises on her side such as that if she came home cold she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly if hungry that she would take something to eat that her own maid should sit up for her and that serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house as usual . chapter viii frank churchill came back again and if he kept his fathers dinner waiting it was not known at hartfield for mrs .  weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr .  woodhouse to betray any imperfection which could be concealed . he came back had had his hair cut and laughed at himself with a very good grace but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done . he had no reason to wish his hair longer to conceal any confusion of face no reason to wish the money unspent to improve his spirits . he was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever and after seeing him emma thus moralised to herself i do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way . wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not always folly . it depends upon the character of those who handle it . mr .  knightley he is not a trifling silly young man . if he were he would have done this differently . he would either have gloried in the achievement or been ashamed of it . there would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities . no i am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly . with tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again and for a longer time than hitherto of judging of his general manners and by inference of the meaning of his manners towards herself of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air and of fancying what the observations of all those might be who were now seeing them together for the first time . she meant to be very happy in spite of the scene being laid at mr .  coles and without being able to forget that among the failings of mr .  elton even in the days of his favour none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with mr .  cole . her fathers comfort was amply secured mrs .  bates as well as mrs .  goddard being able to come and her last pleasing duty before she left the house was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress to make the two ladies all the amends in her power by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine for whatever unwilling selfdenial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal . she had provided a plentiful dinner for them she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it . she followed another carriage to mr .  coles door and was pleased to see that it was mr .  knightleys for mr .  knightley keeping no horses having little spare money and a great deal of health activity and independence was too apt in emmas opinion to get about as he could and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of donwell abbey . she had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart for he stopped to hand her out . this is coming as you should do said she like a gentleman . i am quite glad to see you . he thanked her observing how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment for if we had met first in the drawingroom i doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual . you might not have distinguished how i came by my look or manner . yes i should i am sure i should . there is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them . you think you carry it off very well i dare say but with you it is a sort of bravado an air of affected unconcern i always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances . now you have nothing to try for . you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed . you are not striving to look taller than any body else . now i shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you . nonsensical girl was his reply but not at all in anger . emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with mr .  knightley . she was received with a cordial respect which could not but please and given all the consequence she could wish for . when the westons arrived the kindest looks of love the strongest of admiration were for her from both husband and wife the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object and at dinner she found him seated by herand as she firmly believed not without some dexterity on his side . the party was rather large as it included one other family a proper unobjectionable country family whom the coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance and the male part of mr .  coxs family the lawyer of highbury . the less worthy females were to come in the evening with miss bates miss fairfax and miss smith but already at dinner they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general and while politics and mr .  elton were talked over emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour . the first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend was the name of jane fairfax . mrs .  cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting . she listened and found it well worth listening to . that very dear part of emma her fancy received an amusing supply . mrs .  cole was telling that she had been calling on miss bates and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianofortea very elegant looking instrumentnot a grand but a largesized square pianoforte and the substance of the story the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize and inquiry and congratulations on her side and explanations on miss batess was that this pianoforte had arrived from broadwoods the day before to the great astonishment of both aunt and nieceentirely unexpected that at first by miss batess account jane herself was quite at a loss quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it but now they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarterof course it must be from colonel campbell . one can suppose nothing else added mrs .  cole and i was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt . but jane it seems had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said about it . she knows their ways best but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present . they might chuse to surprize her . mrs .  cole had many to agree with her every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made and there were enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way and still listen to mrs .  cole . i declare i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfactionit always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax who plays so delightfully should not have an instrument . it seemed quite a shame especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away . this is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure and it was but yesterday i was telling mr .  cole i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawingroom while i do not know one note from another and our little girls who are but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world to amuse herself with . i was saying this to mr .  cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it . we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening . miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs .  coles turned to frank churchill . why do you smile said she . nay why do you mei suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbells being so rich and so liberal . it is a handsome present . very . i rather wonder that it was never made before . perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before . or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument which must now be shut up in london untouched by any body . that is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large for mrs .  batess house . you may say what you chusebut your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine . i do not know . i rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than i deserve . i smile because you smile and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect but at present i do not see what there is to question . if colonel campbell is not the person who can be what do you say to mrs .  dixon mrs .  dixon very true indeed . i had not thought of mrs .  dixon . she must know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument would be and perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize is more like a young womans scheme than an elderly mans . it is mrs .  dixon i dare say . i told you that your suspicions would guide mine . if so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend mr .  dixon in them . mr .  dixon . very well . yes i immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of mr .  and mrs .  dixon . we were speaking the other day you know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance . yes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which i had entertained before . i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr .  dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help suspecting either that after making his proposals to her friend he had the misfortune to fall in love with her or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side . one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right but i am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland . here she must be leading a life of privation and penance there it would have been all enjoyment . as to the pretence of trying her native air i look upon that as a mere excuse . in the summer it might have passed but what can any bodys native air do for them in the months of january february and march good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i dare say in hers . i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions though you make so noble a profession of doing it but i honestly tell you what they are . and upon my word they have an air of great probability . mr .  dixons preference of her music to her friends i can answer for being very decided . and then he saved her life . did you ever hear of that a water party and by some accident she was falling overboard . he caught her . he did . i was thereone of the party . were you reallywellbut you observed nothing of course for it seems to be a new idea to you . if i had been there i think i should have made some discoveries . i dare say you would but i simple i saw nothing but the fact that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr .  dixon caught her . it was the work of a moment . and though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durableindeed i believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable . i do not mean to say however that you might not have made discoveries . the conversation was here interrupted . they were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others but when the table was again safely covered when every corner dish was placed exactly right and occupation and ease were generally restored emma said the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me . i wanted to know a little more and this tells me quite enough . depend upon it we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr .  and mrs .  dixon . and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells . no i am sure it is not from the campbells . miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells or they would have been guessed at first . she would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them . i may not have convinced you perhaps but i am perfectly convinced myself that mr .  dixon is a principal in the business . indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced . your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely . at first while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver i saw it only as paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing in the world . but when you mentioned mrs .  dixon i felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship . and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love . there was no occasion to press the matter farther . the conviction seemed real he looked as if he felt it . she said no more other subjects took their turn and the rest of the dinner passed away the dessert succeeded the children came in and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation a few clever things said a few downright silly but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the othernothing worse than everyday remarks dull repetitions old news and heavy jokes . the ladies had not been long in the drawingroom before the other ladies in their different divisions arrived . emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner but could most heartily rejoice in that light cheerful unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection . there she satand who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding to be in company nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed to sit and smile and look pretty and say nothing was enough for the happiness of the present hour . jane fairfax did look and move superior but emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with harriet very glad to have purchased the mortification of having lovedyes of having loved even mr .  elton in vainby the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend . in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her . she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte she felt too much in the secret herself to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair and therefore purposely kept at a distance but by the others the subject was almost immediately introduced and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of my excellent friend colonel campbell . mrs .  weston kindhearted and musical was particularly interested by the circumstance and emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject and having so much to ask and to say as to tone touch and pedal totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible which she plainly read in the fair heroines countenance . they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen and the very first of the early was frank churchill . in he walked the first and the handsomest and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and her niece made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle where sat miss woodhouse and till he could find a seat by her would not sit at all . emma divined what every body present must be thinking . she was his object and every body must perceive it . she introduced him to her friend miss smith and at convenient moments afterwards heard what each thought of the other . he had never seen so lovely a face and was delighted with her naivete . and she only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment but she did think there were some looks a little like mr .  elton . emma restrained her indignation and only turned from her in silence . smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards miss fairfax but it was most prudent to avoid speech . he told her that he had been impatient to leave the diningroom hated sitting longwas always the first to move when he could that his father mr .  knightley mr .  cox and mr .  cole were left very busy over parish businessthat as long as he had staid however it had been pleasant enough as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike sensible men and spoke so handsomely of highbury altogetherthought it so abundant in agreeable families that emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much . she questioned him as to the society in yorkshire the extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe and the sort and could make out from his answers that as far as enscombe was concerned there was very little going on that their visitings were among a range of great families none very near and that even when days were fixed and invitations accepted it was an even chance that mrs .  churchill were not in health and spirits for going that they made a point of visiting no fresh person and that though he had his separate engagements it was not without difficulty without considerable address at times that he could get away or introduce an acquaintance for a night . she saw that enscombe could not satisfy and that highbury taken at its best might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked . his importance at enscombe was very evident . he did not boast but it naturally betrayed itself that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing and on her laughing and noticing it he owned that he believed excepting one or two points he could with time persuade her to any thing . one of those points on which his influence failed he then mentioned . he had wanted very much to go abroadhad been very eager indeed to be allowed to travelbut she would not hear of it . this had happened the year before . now he said he was beginning to have no longer the same wish . the unpersuadable point which he did not mention emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father . i have made a most wretched discovery said he after a short pause . i have been here a week tomorrowhalf my time . i never knew days fly so fast . a week tomorrowand i have hardly begun to enjoy myself . but just got acquainted with mrs .  weston and others i hate the recollection . perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day out of so few in having your hair cut . no said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all . i have no pleasure in seeing my friends unless i can believe myself fit to be seen . the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes and listen to mr .  cole . when mr .  cole had moved away and her attention could be restored as before she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room at miss fairfax who was sitting exactly opposite . what is the matter said she . he started . thank you for rousing me he replied . i believe i have been very rude but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a wayso very odd a waythat i cannot keep my eyes from her . i never saw any thing so outreethose curlsthis must be a fancy of her own . i see nobody else looking like her i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion . shall i yes i willi declare i willand you shall see how she takes it whether she colours . he was gone immediately and emma soon saw him standing before miss fairfax and talking to her but as to its effect on the young lady as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them exactly in front of miss fairfax she could absolutely distinguish nothing . before he could return to his chair it was taken by mrs .  weston . this is the luxury of a large party said sheone can get near every body and say every thing . my dear emma i am longing to talk to you . i have been making discoveries and forming plans just like yourself and i must tell them while the idea is fresh . do you know how miss bates and her niece came here howthey were invited were not they oh yesbut how they were conveyed hitherthe manner of their coming they walked i conclude . how else could they come very true . well a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night and cold as the nights are now . and as i looked at her though i never saw her appear to more advantage it struck me that she was heated and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold . poor girl i could not bear the idea of it so as soon as mr .  weston came into the room and i could get at him i spoke to him about the carriage . you may guess how readily he came into my wishes and having his approbation i made my way directly to miss bates to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once . good soul she was as grateful as possible you may be sure . nobody was ever so fortunate as herselfbut with many many thanksthere was no occasion to trouble us for mr .  knightleys carriage had brought and was to take them home again . i was quite surprizedvery glad i am sure but really quite surprized . such a very kind attentionand so thoughtful an attention the sort of thing that so few men would think of . and in short from knowing his usual ways i am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all . i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them . very likely said emmanothing more likely . i know no man more likely than mr .  knightley to do the sort of thingto do any thing really goodnatured useful considerate or benevolent . he is not a gallant man but he is a very humane one and this considering jane fairfaxs illhealth would appear a case of humanity to himand for an act of unostentatious kindness there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr .  knightley . i know he had horses todayfor we arrived together and i laughed at him about it but he said not a word that could betray . well said mrs .  weston smiling you give him credit for more simple disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do for while miss bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head and i have never been able to get it out again . the more i think of it the more probable it appears . in short i have made a match between mr .  knightley and jane fairfax . see the consequence of keeping you companywhat do you say to it mr .  knightley and jane fairfax exclaimed emma . dear mrs .  weston how could you think of such a thingmr . knightleymr . knightley must not marryyou would not have little henry cut out from donwell oh no no henry must have donwell . i cannot at all consent to mr .  knightleys marrying and i am sure it is not at all likely . i am amazed that you should think of such a thing . my dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it . i do not want the matchi do not want to injure dear little henry but the idea has been given me by circumstances and if mr .  knightley really wished to marry you would not have him refrain on henrys account a boy of six years old who knows nothing of the matter yes i would . i could not bear to have henry supplanted . mr .  knightley marryno i have never had such an idea and i cannot adopt it now . and jane fairfax too of all women nay she has always been a first favourite with him as you very well know . but the imprudence of such a match i am not speaking of its prudence merely its probability . i see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation than what you mention . his goodnature his humanity as i tell you would be quite enough to account for the horses . he has a great regard for the bateses you know independent of jane fairfax and is always glad to shew them attention . my dear mrs .  weston do not take to matchmaking . you do it very ill .  jane fairfax mistress of the abbeyoh no noevery feeling revolts . for his own sake i would not have him do so mad a thing . imprudent if you pleasebut not mad . excepting inequality of fortune and perhaps a little disparity of age i can see nothing unsuitable . but mr .  knightley does not want to marry . i am sure he has not the least idea of it . do not put it into his head . why should he marry he is as happy as possible by himself with his farm and his sheep and his library and all the parish to manage and he is extremely fond of his brothers children . he has no occasion to marry either to fill up his time or his heart . my dear emma as long as he thinks so it is so but if he really loves jane fairfax nonsense he does not care about jane fairfax . in the way of love i am sure he does not . he would do any good to her or her family but well said mrs .  weston laughing perhaps the greatest good he could do them would be to give jane such a respectable home . if it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself a very shameful and degrading connexion . how would he bear to have miss bates belonging to himto have her haunting the abbey and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane so very kind and obligingbut he always had been such a very kind neighbour and then fly off through half a sentence to her mothers old petticoat . not that it was such a very old petticoat eitherfor still it would last a great whileand indeed she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong . for shame emma do not mimic her . you divert me against my conscience . and upon my word i do not think mr .  knightley would be much disturbed by miss bates . little things do not irritate him . she might talk on and if he wanted to say any thing himself he would only talk louder and drown her voice . but the question is not whether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wishes it and i think he does . i have heard him speak and so must you so very highly of jane fairfax the interest he takes in her his anxiety about her healthhis concern that she should have no happier prospect i have heard him express himself so warmly on those pointssuch an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte and of her voice i have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever . oh and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to methis pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the campbells may it not be from mr .  knightley i cannot help suspecting him . i think he is just the person to do it even without being in love . then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love . but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do . mr .  knightley does nothing mysteriously . i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly oftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would in the common course of things occur to him . very well and if he had intended to give her one he would have told her so . there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma . i have a very strong notion that it comes from him . i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs .  cole told us of it at dinner . you take up an idea mrs .  weston and run away with it as you have many a time reproached me with doing . i see no sign of attachment i believe nothing of the pianoforteand proof only shall convince me that mr .  knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax . they combated the point some time longer in the same way emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend for mrs .  weston was the most used of the two to yield till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over and the instrument in preparation and at the same moment mr .  cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it . frank churchill of whom in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs .  weston she had been seeing nothing except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax followed mr .  cole to add his very pressing entreaties and as in every respect it suited emma best to lead she gave a very proper compliance . she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable and could accompany her own voice well . one accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprizea second slightly but correctly taken by frank churchill . her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song and every thing usual followed . he was accused of having a delightful voice and a perfect knowledge of music which was properly denied and that he knew nothing of the matter and had no voice at all roundly asserted . they sang together once more and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax whose performance both vocal and instrumental she never could attempt to conceal from herself was infinitely superior to her own . with mixed feelings she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument to listen . frank churchill sang again . they had sung together once or twice it appeared at weymouth . but the sight of mr .  knightley among the most attentive soon drew away half emmas mind and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of mrs .  westons suspicions to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions . her objections to mr .  knightleys marrying did not in the least subside . she could see nothing but evil in it . it would be a great disappointment to mr .  john knightley consequently to isabella . a real injury to the childrena most mortifying change and material loss to them alla very great deduction from her fathers daily comfortand as to herself she could not at all endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey . a mrs .  knightley for them all to give way tonomr . knightley must never marry . little henry must remain the heir of donwell . presently mr .  knightley looked back and came and sat down by her . they talked at first only of the performance . his admiration was certainly very warm yet she thought but for mrs .  weston it would not have struck her . as a sort of touchstone however she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own . i often feel concern said she that i dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions . it is not that i am without the wish but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should putto for such a purpose . quite out of the question quite out of the question he replied but you must often wish it i am sure . and he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction that she must proceed another step . this present from the campbells said shethis pianoforte is very kindly given . yes he replied and without the smallest apparent embarrassment . but they would have done better had they given her notice of it . surprizes are foolish things . the pleasure is not enhanced and the inconvenience is often considerable . i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell . from that moment emma could have taken her oath that mr .  knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument . but whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachmentwhether there were no actual preferenceremained a little longer doubtful . towards the end of janes second song her voice grew thick . that will do said he when it was finished thinking aloud you have sung quite enough for one eveningnow be quiet . another song however was soon begged for . one morethey would not fatigue miss fairfax on any account and would only ask for one more . and frank churchill was heard to say i think you could manage this without effort the first part is so very trifling . the strength of the song falls on the second . mr .  knightley grew angry . that fellow said he indignantly thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice . this must not be . and touching miss bates who at that moment passed nearmiss bates are you mad to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner go and interfere . they have no mercy on her . miss bates in her real anxiety for jane could hardly stay even to be grateful before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing . here ceased the concert part of the evening for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers but soon within five minutes the proposal of dancing originating nobody exactly knew wherewas so effectually promoted by mr .  and mrs .  cole that every thing was rapidly clearing away to give proper space . mrs .  weston capital in her countrydances was seated and beginning an irresistible waltz and frank churchill coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma had secured her hand and led her up to the top . while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off emma found time in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste to look about and see what became of mr .  knightley . this would be a trial . he was no dancer in general . if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now it might augur something . there was no immediate appearance . no he was talking to mrs .  cole he was looking on unconcerned jane was asked by somebody else and he was still talking to mrs .  cole . emma had no longer an alarm for henry his interest was yet safe and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment . not more than five couple could be mustered but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful and she found herself well matched in a partner . they were a couple worth looking at . two dances unfortunately were all that could be allowed . it was growing late and miss bates became anxious to get home on her mothers account . after some attempts therefore to be permitted to begin again they were obliged to thank mrs .  weston look sorrowful and have done . perhaps it is as well said frank churchill as he attended emma to her carriage . i must have asked miss fairfax and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me after yours . chapter ix emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles . the visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity . she must have delighted the colesworthy people who deserved to be made happyand left a name behind her that would not soon die away . perfect happiness even in memory is not common and there were two points on which she was not quite easy . she doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman in betraying her suspicions of jane fairfaxs feelings to frank churchill . it was hardly right but it had been so strong an idea that it would escape her and his submission to all that she told was a compliment to her penetration which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue . the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax and there she had no doubt . she did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing . she did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhoodand sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half . she was then interrupted by harriets coming in and if harriets praise could have satisfied her she might soon have been comforted . oh if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax dont class us together harriet . my playing is no more like hers than a lamp is like sunshine . oh deari think you play the best of the two . i think you play quite as well as she does . i am sure i had much rather hear you . every body last night said how well you played . those who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference . the truth is harriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised but jane fairfaxs is much beyond it . well i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out . mr .  cole said how much taste you had and mr .  frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste and that he valued taste much more than execution . ah but jane fairfax has them both harriet . are you sure i saw she had execution but i did not know she had any taste . nobody talked about it . and i hate italian singing . there is no understanding a word of it . besides if she does play so very well you know it is no more than she is obliged to do because she will have to teach . the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family . how did you think the coxes looked just as they always dovery vulgar . they told me something said harriet rather hesitatingly but it is nothing of any consequence . emma was obliged to ask what they had told her though fearful of its producing mr .  elton . they told methat mr .  martin dined with them last saturday . oh he came to their father upon some business and he asked him to stay to dinner . oh they talked a great deal about him especially anne cox . i do not know what she meant but she asked me if i thought i should go and stay there again next summer . she meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox should be . she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there . he sat by her at dinner . miss nash thinks either of the coxes would be very glad to marry him . very likely . i think they are without exception the most vulgar girls in highbury . harriet had business at fords . emma thought it most prudent to go with her . another accidental meeting with the martins was possible and in her present state would be dangerous . harriet tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word was always very long at a purchase and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind emma went to the door for amusement . much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury mr .  perry walking hastily by mr .  william cox letting himself in at the officedoor mr .  coles carriagehorses returning from exercise or a stray letterboy on an obstinate mule were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone and a string of dawdling children round the bakers little bowwindow eyeing the gingerbread she knew she had no reason to complain and was amused enough quite enough still to stand at the door . a mind lively and at ease can do with seeing nothing and can see nothing that does not answer . she looked down the randalls road . the scene enlarged two persons appeared mrs .  weston and her soninlaw they were walking into highburyto hartfield of course . they were stopping however in the first place at mrs .  batess whose house was a little nearer randalls than fords and had all but knocked when emma caught their eye . immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her and the agreeableness of yesterdays engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting . mrs .  weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses in order to hear the new instrument . for my companion tells me said she that i absolutely promised miss bates last night that i would come this morning . i was not aware of it myself . i did not know that i had fixed a day but as he says i did i am going now . and while mrs .  weston pays her visit i may be allowed i hope said frank churchill to join your party and wait for her at hartfield if you are going home . mrs .  weston was disappointed . i thought you meant to go with me . they would be very much pleased . me i should be quite in the way . but perhapsi may be equally in the way here . miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me . my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping . she says i fidget her to death and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same . what am i to do i am here on no business of my own said emma i am only waiting for my friend . she will probably have soon done and then we shall go home . but you had better go with mrs .  weston and hear the instrument . wellif you advise it . but with a smile if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an indifferent tonewhat shall i say i shall be no support to mrs .  weston . she might do very well by herself . a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood . i do not believe any such thing replied emma . i am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent . quite otherwise indeed if i understood miss fairfaxs opinion last night . do come with me said mrs .  weston if it be not very disagreeable to you . it need not detain us long . we will go to hartfield afterwards . we will follow them to hartfield . i really wish you to call with me . it will be felt so great an attention and i always thought you meant it . he could say no more and with the hope of hartfield to reward him returned with mrs .  weston to mrs .  batess door . emma watched them in and then joined harriet at the interesting countertrying with all the force of her own mind to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured and that a blue ribbon be it ever so beautiful would still never match her yellow pattern . at last it was all settled even to the destination of the parcel . should i send it to mrs .  goddards maam asked mrs .  ford . yesnoyes to mrs .  goddards . only my pattern gown is at hartfield . no you shall send it to hartfield if you please . but then mrs .  goddard will want to see it . and i could take the pattern gown home any day . but i shall want the ribbon directly so it had better go to hartfieldat least the ribbon . you could make it into two parcels mrs .  ford could not you it is not worth while harriet to give mrs .  ford the trouble of two parcels . no more it is . no trouble in the world maam said the obliging mrs .  ford . oh but indeed i would much rather have it only in one . then if you please you shall send it all to mrs .  goddards i do not knowno i think miss woodhouse i may just as well have it sent to hartfield and take it home with me at night . what do you advise that you do not give another halfsecond to the subject . to hartfield if you please mrs .  ford . aye that will be much best said harriet quite satisfied i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs .  goddards . voices approached the shopor rather one voice and two ladies mrs .  weston and miss bates met them at the door . my dear miss woodhouse said the latter i am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while and give us your opinion of our new instrument you and miss smith . how do you do miss smithvery well i thank you . and i begged mrs .  weston to come with me that i might be sure of succeeding . i hope mrs .  bates and miss fairfax are very well i am much obliged to you . my mother is delightfully well and jane caught no cold last night . how is mr .  woodhousei am so glad to hear such a good account . mrs .  weston told me you were here . oh then said i i must run across i am sure miss woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in my mother will be so very happy to see herand now we are such a nice party she cannot refuse . aye pray do said mr .  frank churchill miss woodhouses opinion of the instrument will be worth having . but said i i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me . oh said he wait half a minute till i have finished my jobfor would you believe it miss woodhouse there he is in the most obliging manner in the world fastening in the rivet of my mothers spectacles . the rivet came out you know this morning . so very obligingfor my mother had no use of her spectacles could not put them on . and by the bye every body ought to have two pair of spectacles they should indeed . jane said so . i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did but something or other hindered me all the morning first one thing then another there is no saying what you know . at one time patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping . oh said i patty do not come with your bad news to me . here is the rivet of your mistresss spectacles out . then the baked apples came home mrs .  wallis sent them by her boy they are extremely civil and obliging to us the wallises alwaysi have heard some people say that mrs .  wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them . and it cannot be for the value of our custom now for what is our consumption of bread you know only three of us . besides dear jane at presentand she really eats nothingmakes such a shocking breakfast you would be quite frightened if you saw it . i dare not let my mother know how little she eatsso i say one thing and then i say another and it passes off . but about the middle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr .  perry i happened to meet him in the street . not that i had any doubt before i have so often heard mr .  woodhouse recommend a baked apple . i believe it is the only way that mr .  woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome . we have appledumplings however very often . patty makes an excellent appledumpling . well mrs .  weston you have prevailed i hope and these ladies will oblige us . emma would be very happy to wait on mrs .  bates c .  and they did at last move out of the shop with no farther delay from miss bates than how do you do mrs .  ford i beg your pardon . i did not see you before . i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town . jane came back delighted yesterday . thank ye the gloves do very wellonly a little too large about the wrist but jane is taking them in . what was i talking of said she beginning again when they were all in the street . emma wondered on what of all the medley she would fix . i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of . oh my mothers spectacles . so very obliging of mr .  frank churchill oh said he i do think i can fasten the rivet i like a job of this kind excessively . which you know shewed him to be so very .  .  .  . indeed i must say that much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected he very far exceeds any thing .  .  .  . i do congratulate you mrs .  weston most warmly . he seems every thing the fondest parent could .  .  .  . oh said he i can fasten the rivet . i like a job of that sort excessively . i never shall forget his manner . and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some oh said he directly there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good and these are the finestlooking homebaked apples i ever saw in my life . that you know was so very .  .  .  . and i am sure by his manner it was no compliment . indeed they are very delightful apples and mrs .  wallis does them full justiceonly we do not have them baked more than twice and mr .  woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it . the apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking beyond a doubt all from donwellsome of mr .  knightleys most liberal supply . he sends us a sack every year and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his treesi believe there is two of them . my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days . but i was really quite shocked the other day for mr .  knightley called one morning and jane was eating these apples and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock . i am sure you must be said he and i will send you another supply for i have a great many more than i can ever use . william larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year . i will send you some more before they get good for nothing . so i begged he would notfor really as to ours being gone i could not absolutely say that we had a great many leftit was but half a dozen indeed but they should be all kept for jane and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more so liberal as he had been already and jane said the same . and when he was gone she almost quarrelled with meno i should not say quarrelled for we never had a quarrel in our lives but she was quite distressed that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone she wished i had made him believe we had a great many left . oh said i my dear i did say as much as i could . however the very same evening william larkins came over with a large basket of apples the same sort of apples a bushel at least and i was very much obliged and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing as you may suppose . william larkins is such an old acquaintance i am always glad to see him . but however i found afterwards from patty that william said it was all the apples of that sort his master had he had brought them alland now his master had not one left to bake or boil . william did not seem to mind it himself he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many for william you know thinks more of his masters profit than any thing but mrs .  hodges he said was quite displeased at their being all sent away . she could not bear that her master should not be able to have another appletart this spring . he told patty this but bid her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us about it for mrs .  hodges would be cross sometimes and as long as so many sacks were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder . and so patty told me and i was excessively shocked indeed i would not have mr .  knightley know any thing about it for the world he would be so very .  .  .  . i wanted to keep it from janes knowledge but unluckily i had mentioned it before i was aware . miss bates had just done as patty opened the door and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to pursued only by the sounds of her desultory goodwill . pray take care mrs .  weston there is a step at the turning . pray take care miss woodhouse ours is rather a dark staircase rather darker and narrower than one could wish . miss smith pray take care . miss woodhouse i am quite concerned i am sure you hit your foot . miss smith the step at the turning . chapter x the appearance of the little sittingroom as they entered was tranquillity itself mrs .  bates deprived of her usual employment slumbering on one side of the fire frank churchill at a table near her most deedily occupied about her spectacles and jane fairfax standing with her back to them intent on her pianoforte . busy as he was however the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing emma again . this is a pleasure said he in rather a low voice coming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated . you find me trying to be useful tell me if you think i shall succeed . what said mrs .  weston have not you finished it yet you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate . i have not been working uninterruptedly he replied i have been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily it was not quite firm an unevenness in the floor i believe . you see we have been wedging one leg with paper . this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come . i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home . he contrived that she should be seated by him and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her and trying to make her help or advise him in his work till jane fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again . that she was not immediately ready emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion she must reason herself into the power of performance and emma could not but pity such feelings whatever their origin and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again . at last jane began and though the first bars were feebly given the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to . mrs .  weston had been delighted before and was delighted again emma joined her in all her praise and the pianoforte with every proper discrimination was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise . whoever colonel campbell might employ said frank churchill with a smile at emma the person has not chosen ill .  i heard a good deal of colonel campbells taste at weymouth and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize . i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave his friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself . do not you think so jane did not look round . she was not obliged to hear . mrs .  weston had been speaking to her at the same moment . it is not fair said emma in a whisper mine was a random guess . do not distress her . he shook his head with a smile and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy . soon afterwards he began again how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion miss fairfax . i dare say they often think of you and wonder which will be the day the precise day of the instruments coming to hand . do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this timedo you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him or that he may have sent only a general direction an order indefinite as to time to depend upon contingencies and conveniences he paused . she could not but hear she could not avoid answering till i have a letter from colonel campbell said she in a voice of forced calmness i can imagine nothing with any confidence . it must be all conjecture . conjectureaye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one conjectures wrong . i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this rivet quite firm . what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse when hard at work if one talks at allyour real workmen i suppose hold their tongues but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a wordmiss fairfax said something about conjecturing . there it is done . i have the pleasure madam to mrs .  bates of restoring your spectacles healed for the present . he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter to escape a little from the latter he went to the pianoforte and begged miss fairfax who was still sitting at it to play something more . if you are very kind said he it will be one of the waltzes we danced last nightlet me live them over again . you did not enjoy them as i did you appeared tired the whole time . i believe you were glad we danced no longer but i would have given worlds all the worlds one ever has to givefor another halfhour . she played . what felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth . she looked up at him for a moment coloured deeply and played something else . he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte and turning to emma said here is something quite new to me . do you know itcramer . and here are a new set of irish melodies . that from such a quarter one might expect . this was all sent with the instrument . very thoughtful of colonel campbell was not ithe knew miss fairfax could have no music here . i honour that part of the attention particularly it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart . nothing hastily done nothing incomplete . true affection only could have prompted it . emma wished he would be less pointed yet could not help being amused and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught the remains of a smile when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness there had been a smile of secret delight she had less scruple in the amusement and much less compunction with respect to her . this amiable upright perfect jane fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings . he brought all the music to her and they looked it over together . emma took the opportunity of whispering you speak too plain . she must understand you . i hope she does . i would have her understand me . i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning . but really i am half ashamed and wish i had never taken up the idea . i am very glad you did and that you communicated it to me . i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways . leave shame to her . if she does wrong she ought to feel it . she is not entirely without it i think . i do not see much sign of it . she is playing robin adair at this momenthis favourite . shortly afterwards miss bates passing near the window descried mr .  knightley on horseback not far off . mr .  knightley i declarei must speak to him if possible just to thank him . i will not open the window here it would give you all cold but i can go into my mothers room you know . i dare say he will come in when he knows who is here . quite delightful to have you all meet soour little room so honoured she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke and opening the casement there immediately called mr .  knightleys attention and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others as if it had passed within the same apartment . how d ye dohow dye dovery well i thank you . so obliged to you for the carriage last night . we were just in time my mother just ready for us . pray come in do come in . you will find some friends here . so began miss bates and mr .  knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn for most resolutely and commandingly did he say how is your niece miss batesi want to inquire after you all but particularly your niece . how is miss fairfaxi hope she caught no cold last night . how is she today tell me how miss fairfax is . and miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else . the listeners were amused and mrs .  weston gave emma a look of particular meaning . but emma still shook her head in steady scepticism . so obliged to youso very much obliged to you for the carriage resumed miss bates . he cut her short with i am going to kingston . can i do any thing for you oh dear kingstonare youmrs . cole was saying the other day she wanted something from kingston . mrs .  cole has servants to send . can i do any thing for you no i thank you . but do come in . who do you think is here miss woodhouse and miss smith so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte . do put up your horse at the crown and come in . well said he in a deliberating manner for five minutes perhaps . and here is mrs .  weston and mr .  frank churchill tooquite delightful so many friends no not now i thank you . i could not stay two minutes . i must get on to kingston as fast as i can . oh do come in . they will be so very happy to see you . no no your room is full enough . i will call another day and hear the pianoforte . well i am so sorryoh mr .  knightley what a delightful party last night how extremely pleasant . did you ever see such dancing was not it delightfulmiss woodhouse and mr .  frank churchill i never saw any thing equal to it . oh very delightful indeed i can say nothing less for i suppose miss woodhouse and mr .  frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes . and raising his voice still more i do not see why miss fairfax should not be mentioned too . i think miss fairfax dances very well and mrs .  weston is the very best countrydance player without exception in england . now if your friends have any gratitude they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return but i cannot stay to hear it . oh mr .  knightley one moment more something of consequence so shockedjane and i are both so shocked about the apples what is the matter now to think of your sending us all your store apples . you said you had a great many and now you have not one left . we really are so shocked mrs .  hodges may well be angry . william larkins mentioned it here . you should not have done it indeed you should not . ah he is off . he never can bear to be thanked . but i thought he would have staid now and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned .  .  .  . well returning to the room i have not been able to succeed . mr .  knightley cannot stop . he is going to kingston . he asked me if he could do any thing .  .  .  . yes said jane we heard his kind offers we heard every thing . oh yes my dear i dare say you might because you know the door was open and the window was open and mr .  knightley spoke loud . you must have heard every thing to be sure . can i do any thing for you at kingston said he so i just mentioned .  .  .  . oh miss woodhouse must you be goingyou seem but just comeso very obliging of you . emma found it really time to be at home the visit had already lasted long and on examining watches so much of the morning was perceived to be gone that mrs .  weston and her companion taking leave also could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield gates before they set off for randalls . chapter xi it may be possible to do without dancing entirely . instances have been known of young people passing many many months successively without being at any ball of any description and no material injury accrue either to body or mindbut when a beginning is made when the felicities of rapid motion have once been though slightly feltit must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more . frank churchill had danced once at highbury and longed to dance again and the last halfhour of an evening which mr .  woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at randalls was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject . franks was the first idea and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance . but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr .  frank churchill and miss woodhouse dancedfor doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane fairfaxand even for simple dancing itself without any of the wicked aids of vanityto assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to holdand then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour in the hope of discovering in spite of all that mr .  weston could say of their exactly equal size that it was a little the largest . his first proposition and request that the dance begun at mr .  coles should be finished therethat the same party should be collected and the same musician engaged met with the readiest acquiescence . mr .  weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment and mrs .  weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance and the interesting employment had followed of reckoning up exactly who there would be and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple . you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five had been repeated many times over . and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr .  knightley . yes that will be quite enough for pleasure . you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room . but soon it came to be on one side but will there be good room for five couplei really do not think there will . on another and after all five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up . five couple are nothing when one thinks seriously about it . it will not do to invite five couple . it can be allowable only as the thought of the moment . somebody said that miss gilbert was expected at her brothers and must be invited with the rest . somebody else believed mrs .  gilbert would have danced the other evening if she had been asked . a word was put in for a second young cox and at last mr .  weston naming one family of cousins who must be included and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of . the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other . might not they use both rooms and dance across the passage it seemed the best scheme and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better . emma said it would be awkward mrs .  weston was in distress about the supper and mr .  woodhouse opposed it earnestly on the score of health . it made him so very unhappy indeed that it could not be persevered in . oh no said he it would be the extreme of imprudence . i could not bear it for emmaemma is not strong . she would catch a dreadful cold . so would poor little harriet . so you would all . mrs .  weston you would be quite laid up do not let them talk of such a wild thing . pray do not let them talk of it . that young man speaking lower is very thoughtless . do not tell his father but that young man is not quite the thing . he has been opening the doors very often this evening and keeping them open very inconsiderately . he does not think of the draught . i do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite the thing mrs .  weston was sorry for such a charge . she knew the importance of it and said every thing in her power to do it away . every door was now closed the passage plan given up and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again and with such goodwill on frank churchills part that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten . we were too magnificent said he . we allowed unnecessary room . ten couple may stand here very well . emma demurred . it would be a crowda sad crowd and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in very true he gravely replied it was very bad . but still he went on measuring and still he ended with i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple . no no said she you are quite unreasonable . it would be dreadful to be standing so close nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowdand a crowd in a little room there is no denying it he replied . i agree with you exactly . a crowd in a little roommiss woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures in a few words . exquisite quite exquisitestill however having proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up . it would be a disappointment to my fatherand altogetheri do not know thati am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well . emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little selfwilled and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her but she took the compliment and forgave the rest . had she intended ever to marry him it might have been worth while to pause and consider and try to understand the value of his preference and the character of his temper but for all the purposes of their acquaintance he was quite amiable enough . before the middle of the next day he was at hartfield and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme . it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement . well miss woodhouse he almost immediately began your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away i hope by the terrors of my fathers little rooms . i bring a new proposal on the subjecta thought of my fathers which waits only your approbation to be acted upon . may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball to be given not at randalls but at the crown inn the crown yes if you and mr .  woodhouse see no objection and i trust you cannot my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there . better accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful welcome than at randalls . it is his own idea . mrs .  weston sees no objection to it provided you are satisfied . this is what we all feel . oh you were perfectly right ten couple in either of the randalls rooms would have been insufferabledreadfuli felt how right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing any thing to like to yield . is not it a good exchangeyou consent i hope you consent it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr .  and mrs .  weston do not . i think it admirable and as far as i can answer for myself shall be most happyit seems the only improvement that could be . papa do you not think it an excellent improvement she was obliged to repeat and explain it before it was fully comprehended and then being quite new farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable . no he thought it very far from an improvementa very bad plan much worse than the other . a room at an inn was always damp and dangerous never properly aired or fit to be inhabited . if they must dance they had better dance at randalls . he had never been in the room at the crown in his lifedid not know the people who kept it by sight . oh noa very bad plan . they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere . i was going to observe sir said frank churchill that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any bodys catching cold so much less danger at the crown than at randalls mr .  perry might have reason to regret the alteration but nobody else could . sir said mr .  woodhouse rather warmly you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr .  perry to be that sort of character . mr .  perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill .  but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your fathers house . from the very circumstance of its being larger sir . we shall have no occasion to open the windows at allnot once the whole evening and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold air upon heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief . open the windowsbut surely mr .  churchill nobody would think of opening the windows at randalls . nobody could be so imprudent i never heard of such a thing . dancing with open windowsi am sure neither your father nor mrs .  weston poor miss taylor that was would suffer it . ah sirbut a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a windowcurtain and throw up a sash without its being suspected . i have often known it done myself . have you indeed sirbless me i never could have supposed it . but i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear . however this does make a difference and perhaps when we come to talk it overbut these sort of things require a good deal of consideration . one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry . if mr .  and mrs .  weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done . but unfortunately sir my time is so limited oh interrupted emma there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over . there is no hurry at all . if it can be contrived to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses . they will be so near their own stable . so they will my dear . that is a great thing . not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can . if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly airedbut is mrs .  stokes to be trusted i doubt it . i do not know her even by sight . i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs .  westons care . mrs .  weston undertakes to direct the whole . there papanow you must be satisfiedour own dear mrs .  weston who is carefulness itself . do not you remember what mr .  perry said so many years ago when i had the measles if miss taylor undertakes to wrap miss emma up you need not have any fears sir . how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her aye very true . mr .  perry did say so . i shall never forget it . poor little emma you were very bad with the measles that is you would have been very bad but for perrys great attention . he came four times a day for a week . he said from the first it was a very good sortwhich was our great comfort but the measles are a dreadful complaint . i hope whenever poor isabellas little ones have the measles she will send for perry . my father and mrs .  weston are at the crown at this moment said frank churchill examining the capabilities of the house . i left them there and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot . i was desired to say so from both . it would be the greatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there . they can do nothing satisfactorily without you . emma was most happy to be called to such a council and her father engaging to think it all over while she was gone the two young people set off together without delay for the crown . there were mr .  and mrs .  weston delighted to see her and receive her approbation very busy and very happy in their different way she in some little distress and he finding every thing perfect . emma said she this paper is worse than i expected . look in places you see it is dreadfully dirty and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined . my dear you are too particular said her husband . what does all that signify you will see nothing of it by candlelight . it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight . we never see any thing of it on our clubnights . the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant men never know when things are dirty or not and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares . one perplexity however arose which the gentlemen did not disdain . it regarded a supperroom . at the time of the ballrooms being built suppers had not been in question and a small cardroom adjoining was the only addition . what was to be done this cardroom would be wanted as a cardroom now or if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves still was it not too small for any comfortable supper another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose but it was at the other end of the house and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it . this made a difficulty . mrs .  weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage and neither emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper . mrs .  weston proposed having no regular supper merely sandwiches c .  set out in the little room but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion . a private dance without sitting down to supper was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women and mrs .  weston must not speak of it again . she then took another line of expediency and looking into the doubtful room observed i do not think it is so very small . we shall not be many you know . and mr .  weston at the same time walking briskly with long steps through the passage was calling out you talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear . it is a mere nothing after all and not the least draught from the stairs . i wish said mrs .  weston one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best . to do what would be most generally pleasing must be our objectif one could but tell what that would be . yes very true cried frank very true . you want your neighbours opinions . i do not wonder at you . if one could ascertain what the chief of themthe coles for instance . they are not far off . shall i call upon them or miss bates she is still nearer . and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body . i think we do want a larger council . suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us wellif you please said mrs .  weston rather hesitating if you think she will be of any use . you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates said emma . she will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing . she will not even listen to your questions . i see no advantage in consulting miss bates . but she is so amusing so extremely amusing i am very fond of hearing miss bates talk . and i need not bring the whole family you know . here mr .  weston joined them and on hearing what was proposed gave it his decided approbation . aye do frank . go and fetch miss bates and let us end the matter at once . she will enjoy the scheme i am sure and i do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties . fetch miss bates . we are growing a little too nice . she is a standing lesson of how to be happy . but fetch them both . invite them both . both sir can the old lady  .  .  . the old lady no the young lady to be sure . i shall think you a great blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece . oh i beg your pardon sir . i did not immediately recollect . undoubtedly if you wish it i will endeavour to persuade them both . and away he ran . long before he reappeared attending the short neat briskmoving aunt and her elegant niecemrs . weston like a sweettempered woman and a good wife had examined the passage again and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before indeed very trifling and here ended the difficulties of decision . all the rest in speculation at least was perfectly smooth . all the minor arrangements of table and chair lights and music tea and supper made themselves or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between mrs .  weston and mrs .  stokes . every body invited was certainly to come frank had already written to enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight which could not possibly be refused . and a delightful dance it was to be . most cordially when miss bates arrived did she agree that it must . as a counsellor she was not wanted but as an approver a much safer character she was truly welcome . her approbation at once general and minute warm and incessant could not but please and for another halfhour they were all walking to and fro between the different rooms some suggesting some attending and all in happy enjoyment of the future . the party did not break up without emmas being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening nor without her overhearing mr .  weston whisper to his wife he has asked her my dear . thats right . i knew he would chapter xii one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to emmaits being fixed for a day within the granted term of frank churchills stay in surry for in spite of mr .  westons confidence she could not think it so very impossible that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight . but this was not judged feasible . the preparations must take their time nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on and for a few days they must be planning proceeding and hoping in uncertaintyat the risk in her opinion the great risk of its being all in vain . enscombe however was gracious gracious in fact if not in word . his wish of staying longer evidently did not please but it was not opposed . all was safe and prosperous and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another emma being now certain of her ball began to adopt as the next vexation mr .  knightleys provoking indifference about it . either because he did not dance himself or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted he seemed resolved that it should not interest him determined against its exciting any present curiosity or affording him any future amusement . to her voluntary communications emma could get no more approving reply than very well . if the westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment i have nothing to say against it but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me . oh yes i must be there i could not refuse and i will keep as much awake as i can but i would rather be at home looking over william larkinss weeks account much rather i confess . pleasure in seeing dancingnot i indeedi never look at it i do not know who does . fine dancing i believe like virtue must be its own reward . those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different . this emma felt was aimed at her and it made her quite angry . it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was so indifferent or so indignant he was not guided by her feelings in reprobating the ball for she enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree . it made her animatedopen hearted she voluntarily said oh miss woodhouse i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball . what a disappointment it would be i do look forward to it i own with very great pleasure . it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of william larkins . noshe was more and more convinced that mrs .  weston was quite mistaken in that surmise . there was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his sidebut no love . alas there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr .  knightley . two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the overthrow of every thing . a letter arrived from mr .  churchill to urge his nephews instant return . mrs .  churchill was unwell far too unwell to do without him she had been in a very suffering state so said her husband when writing to her nephew two days before though from her usual unwillingness to give pain and constant habit of never thinking of herself she had not mentioned it but now she was too ill to trifle and must entreat him to set off for enscombe without delay . the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma in a note from mrs .  weston instantly . as to his going it was inevitable . he must be gone within a few hours though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt to lessen his repugnance . he knew her illnesses they never occurred but for her own convenience . mrs .  weston added that he could only allow himself time to hurry to highbury after breakfast and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him and that he might be expected at hartfield very soon . this wretched note was the finale of emmas breakfast . when once it had been read there was no doing any thing but lament and exclaim . the loss of the ballthe loss of the young man and all that the young man might be feelingit was too wretched such a delightful evening as it would have beenevery body so happy and she and her partner the happiesti said it would be so was the only consolation . her fathers feelings were quite distinct . he thought principally of mrs .  churchills illness and wanted to know how she was treated and as for the ball it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed but they would all be safer at home . emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared but if this reflected at all upon his impatience his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him . he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it . his dejection was most evident . he sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes and when rousing himself it was only to say of all horrid things leavetaking is the worst . but you will come again said emma . this will not be your only visit to randalls . ahshaking his headthe uncertainty of when i may be able to returni shall try for it with a zealit will be the object of all my thoughts and caresand if my uncle and aunt go to town this springbut i am afraidthey did not stir last spring i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever . our poor ball must be quite given up . ah that ballwhy did we wait for any thingwhy not seize the pleasure at oncehow often is happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparationyou told us it would be so . oh miss woodhouse why are you always so right indeed i am very sorry to be right in this instance . i would much rather have been merry than wise . if i can come again we are still to have our ball . my father depends on it . do not forget your engagement . emma looked graciously . such a fortnight as it has been he continued every day more precious and more delightful than the day beforeevery day making me less fit to bear any other place . happy those who can remain at highbury as you do us such ample justice now said emma laughing i will venture to ask whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first do not we rather surpass your expectations i am sure we do . i am sure you did not much expect to like us . you would not have been so long in coming if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury . he laughed rather consciously and though denying the sentiment emma was convinced that it had been so . and you must be off this very morning yes my father is to join me here we shall walk back together and i must be off immediately . i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him . not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss bates how unlucky miss batess powerful argumentative mind might have strengthened yours . yesi have called there passing the door i thought it better . it was a right thing to do . i went in for three minutes and was detained by miss batess being absent . she was out and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in . she is a woman that one may that one must laugh at but that one would not wish to slight . it was better to pay my visit then he hesitated got up walked to a window . in short said he perhaps miss woodhousei think you can hardly be quite without suspicion he looked at her as if wanting to read her thoughts . she hardly knew what to say . it seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious which she did not wish . forcing herself to speak therefore in the hope of putting it by she calmly said you are quite in the right it was most natural to pay your visit then he was silent . she believed he was looking at her probably reflecting on what she had said and trying to understand the manner . she heard him sigh . it was natural for him to feel that he had cause to sigh . he could not believe her to be encouraging him . a few awkward moments passed and he sat down again and in a more determined manner said it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to hartfield . my regard for hartfield is most warm he stopt again rose again and seemed quite embarrassed . he was more in love with her than emma had supposed and who can say how it might have ended if his father had not made his appearance mr .  woodhouse soon followed and the necessity of exertion made him composed . a very few minutes more however completed the present trial . mr .  weston always alert when business was to be done and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable as of foreseeing any that was doubtful said it was time to go and the young man though he might and did sigh could not but agree to take leave . i shall hear about you all said he that is my chief consolation . i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you . i have engaged mrs .  weston to correspond with me . she has been so kind as to promise it . oh the blessing of a female correspondent when one is really interested in the absentshe will tell me every thing . in her letters i shall be at dear highbury again . a very friendly shake of the hand a very earnest goodbye closed the speech and the door had soon shut out frank churchill . short had been the noticeshort their meeting he was gone and emma felt so sorry to part and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry and feeling it too much . it was a sad change . they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival . certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeksindescribable spirit the idea the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought the assurance of his attentions his liveliness his manners it had been a very happy fortnight and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of hartfield days . to complete every other recommendation he had almost told her that he loved her . what strength or what constancy of affection he might be subject to was another point but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration a conscious preference of herself and this persuasion joined to all the rest made her think that she must be a little in love with him in spite of every previous determination against it . i certainly must said she . this sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself this feeling of every things being dull and insipid about the house i must be in love i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were notfor a few weeks at least . well evil to some is always good to others . i shall have many fellowmourners for the ball if not for frank churchill but mr .  knightley will be happy . he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes . mr .  knightley however shewed no triumphant happiness . he could not say that he was sorry on his own account his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had but he said and very steadily that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others and with considerable kindness added you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out of luck you are very much out of luck it was some days before she saw jane fairfax to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change but when they did meet her composure was odious . she had been particularly unwell however suffering from headache to a degree which made her aunt declare that had the ball taken place she did not think jane could have attended it and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of illhealth . chapter xiii emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love . her ideas only varied as to the how much . at first she thought it was a good deal and afterwards but little . she had great pleasure in hearing frank churchill talked of and for his sake greater pleasure than ever in seeing mr .  and mrs .  weston she was very often thinking of him and quite impatient for a letter that she might know how he was how were his spirits how was his aunt and what was the chance of his coming to randalls again this spring . but on the other hand she could not admit herself to be unhappy nor after the first morning to be less disposed for employment than usual she was still busy and cheerful and pleasing as he was she could yet imagine him to have faults and farther though thinking of him so much and as she sat drawing or working forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment fancying interesting dialogues and inventing elegant letters the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she refused him . their affection was always to subside into friendship . every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting but still they were to part . when she became sensible of this it struck her that she could not be very much in love for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father never to marry a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings . i do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice said she . in not one of all my clever replies my delicate negatives is there any allusion to making a sacrifice . i do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness . so much the better . i certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do . i am quite enough in love . i should be sorry to be more . upon the whole she was equally contented with her view of his feelings . he is undoubtedly very much in loveevery thing denotes itvery much in love indeedand when he comes again if his affection continue i must be on my guard not to encourage it . it would be most inexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind is quite made up . not that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto . no if he had believed me at all to share his feelings he would not have been so wretched . could he have thought himself encouraged his looks and language at parting would have been different . still however i must be on my guard . this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is but i do not know that i expect it will i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy . his feelings are warm but i can imagine them rather changeable . every consideration of the subject in short makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved . i shall do very well again after a little whileand then it will be a good thing over for they say every body is in love once in their lives and i shall have been let off easily . when his letter to mrs .  weston arrived emma had the perusal of it and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations and think she had undervalued their strength . it was a long wellwritten letter giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings expressing all the affection gratitude and respect which was natural and honourable and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive with spirit and precision . no suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern it was the language of real feeling towards mrs .  weston and the transition from highbury to enscombe the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety . the charm of her own name was not wanting . miss woodhouse appeared more than once and never without a something of pleasing connexion either a compliment to her taste or a remembrance of what she had said and in the very last time of its meeting her eye unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed . compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these wordsi had not a spare moment on tuesday as you know for miss woodhouses beautiful little friend . pray make my excuses and adieus to her . this emma could not doubt was all for herself . harriet was remembered only from being her friend . his information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated mrs .  churchill was recovering and he dared not yet even in his own imagination fix a time for coming to randalls again . gratifying however and stimulative as was the letter in the material part its sentiments she yet found when it was folded up and returned to mrs .  weston that it had not added any lasting warmth that she could still do without the writer and that he must learn to do without her . her intentions were unchanged . her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness . his recollection of harriet and the words which clothed it the beautiful little friend suggested to her the idea of harriets succeeding her in his affections . was it impossibleno . harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour . for harriet it would be advantageous and delightful indeed . i must not dwell upon it said she . i must not think of it . i know the danger of indulging such speculations . but stranger things have happened and when we cease to care for each other as we do now it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward to with pleasure . it was well to have a comfort in store on harriets behalf though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom for evil in that quarter was at hand . as frank churchills arrival had succeeded mr .  eltons engagement in the conversation of highbury as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first so now upon frank churchills disappearance mr .  eltons concerns were assuming the most irresistible form . his weddingday was named . he would soon be among them again mr .  elton and his bride . there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe before mr .  elton and his bride was in every bodys mouth and frank churchill was forgotten . emma grew sick at the sound . she had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr .  elton and harriets mind she had been willing to hope had been lately gaining strength . with mr .  westons ball in view at least there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approachnew carriage bellringing and all . poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma could give . emma felt that she could not do too much for her that harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect for ever agreed to without being able to make their opinions the same . harriet listened submissively and said it was very true it was just as miss woodhouse describedit was not worth while to think about themand she would not think about them any longer but no change of subject could avail and the next halfhour saw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as before . at last emma attacked her on another ground . your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr .  eltons marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can make me . you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into . it was all my doing i know . i have not forgotten it i assure you . deceived myself i did very miserably deceive you and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever . do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it . harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation . emma continued i have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake think less talk less of mr .  elton for my sake because for your own sake rather i would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my comfort a habit of selfcommand in you a consideration of what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity . these are the motives which i have been pressing on you . they are very importantand sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them . my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration . i want you to save yourself from greater pain . perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was dueor rather what would be kind by me . this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest . the idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse whom she really loved extremely made her wretched for a while and when the violence of grief was comforted away still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably . you who have been the best friend i ever had in my life want gratitude to younobody is equal to youi care for nobody as i do for youoh miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been such expressions assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do made emma feel that she had never loved harriet so well nor valued her affection so highly before . there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart said she afterwards to herself . there is nothing to be compared to it . warmth and tenderness of heart with an affectionate open manner will beat all the clearness of head in the world for attraction i am sure it will . it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally belovedwhich gives isabella all her popularity . i have it notbut i know how to prize and respect it . harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives . dear harrieti would not change you for the clearestheaded longestsighted bestjudging female breathing . oh the coldness of a jane fairfaxharriet is worth a hundred suchand for a wife a sensible mans wifeit is invaluable . i mention no names but happy the man who changes emma for harriet chapter xiv mrs .  elton was first seen at church but though devotion might be interrupted curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid to settle whether she were very pretty indeed or only rather pretty or not pretty at all . emma had feelings less of curiosity than of pride or propriety to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects and she made a point of harriets going with her that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible . she could not enter the house again could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago to lace up her boot without recollecting . a thousand vexatious thoughts would recur . compliments charades and horrible blunders and it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be recollecting too but she behaved very well and was only rather pale and silent . the visit was of course short and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it that emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady and on no account to give one beyond the nothingmeaning terms of being elegantly dressed and very pleasing . she did not really like her . she would not be in a hurry to find fault but she suspected that there was no eleganceease but not elegance . she was almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride there was too much ease . her person was rather good her face not unpretty but neither feature nor air nor voice nor manner were elegant . emma thought at least it would turn out so . as for mr .  elton his manners did not appearbut no she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners . it was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it . the woman was better off she might have the assistance of fine clothes and the privilege of bashfulness but the man had only his own good sense to depend on and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor mr .  elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married the woman he had wanted to marry and the woman whom he had been expected to marry she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise and to be as much affectedly and as little really easy as could be . well miss woodhouse said harriet when they had quitted the house and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin well miss woodhouse with a gentle sigh what do you think of her is not she very charming there was a little hesitation in emmas answer . oh yesverya very pleasing young woman . i think her beautiful quite beautiful . very nicely dressed indeed a remarkably elegant gown . i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love . oh nothere is nothing to surprize one at all . a pretty fortune and she came in his way . i dare say returned harriet sighing again i dare say she was very much attached to him . perhaps she might but it is not every mans fate to marry the woman who loves him best . miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home and thought this the best offer she was likely to have . yes said harriet earnestly and well she might nobody could ever have a better . well i wish them happy with all my heart . and now miss woodhouse i do not think i shall mind seeing them again . he is just as superior as everbut being married you know it is quite a different thing . no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraid i can sit and admire him now without any great misery . to know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfort she does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves . happy creature he called her augusta . how delightful when the visit was returned emma made up her mind . she could then see more and judge better . from harriets happening not to be at hartfield and her fathers being present to engage mr .  elton she had a quarter of an hour of the ladys conversation to herself and could composedly attend to her and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that mrs .  elton was a vain woman extremely well satisfied with herself and thinking much of her own importance that she meant to shine and be very superior but with manners which had been formed in a bad school pert and familiar that all her notions were drawn from one set of people and one style of living that if not foolish she was ignorant and that her society would certainly do mr .  elton no good . harriet would have been a better match . if not wise or refined herself she would have connected him with those who were but miss hawkins it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit had been the best of her own set . the rich brotherinlaw near bristol was the pride of the alliance and his place and his carriages were the pride of him . the very first subject after being seated was maple grove my brother mr .  sucklings seata comparison of hartfield to maple grove . the grounds of hartfield were small but neat and pretty and the house was modern and wellbuilt . mrs .  elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room the entrance and all that she could see or imagine . very like maple grove indeedshe was quite struck by the likenessthat room was the very shape and size of the morningroom at maple grove her sisters favourite room . mr .  elton was appealed to . was not it astonishingly like she could really almost fancy herself at maple grove . and the staircaseyou know as i came in i observed how very like the staircase was placed exactly in the same part of the house . i really could not help exclaiming i assure you miss woodhouse it is very delightful to me to be reminded of a place i am so extremely partial to as maple grove . i have spent so many happy months there with a little sigh of sentiment . a charming place undoubtedly . every body who sees it is struck by its beauty but to me it has been quite a home . whenever you are transplanted like me miss woodhouse you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind . i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony . emma made as slight a reply as she could but it was fully sufficient for mrs .  elton who only wanted to be talking herself . so extremely like maple grove and it is not merely the house the grounds i assure you as far as i could observe are strikingly like . the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here and stand very much in the same wayjust across the lawn and i had a glimpse of a fine large tree with a bench round it which put me so exactly in mind my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place . people who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style . emma doubted the truth of this sentiment . she had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else but it was not worth while to attack an error so doubledyed and therefore only said in reply when you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield . surry is full of beauties . oh yes i am quite aware of that . it is the garden of england you know . surry is the garden of england . yes but we must not rest our claims on that distinction . many counties i believe are called the garden of england as well as surry . no i fancy not replied mrs .  elton with a most satisfied smile . i never heard any county but surry called so . emma was silenced . my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring or summer at farthest continued mrs .  elton and that will be our time for exploring . while they are with us we shall explore a great deal i dare say . they will have their barouchelandau of course which holds four perfectly and therefore without saying any thing of our carriage we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well . they would hardly come in their chaise i think at that season of the year . indeed when the time draws on i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouchelandau it will be so very much preferable . when people come into a beautiful country of this sort you know miss woodhouse one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible and mr .  suckling is extremely fond of exploring . we explored to kingsweston twice last summer in that way most delightfully just after their first having the barouchelandau . you have many parties of that kind here i suppose miss woodhouse every summer no not immediately here . we are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of and we are a very quiet set of people i believe more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure . ah there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort . nobody can be more devoted to home than i am . i was quite a proverb for it at maple grove . many a time has selina said when she has been going to bristol i really cannot get this girl to move from the house . i absolutely must go in by myself though i hate being stuck up in the barouchelandau without a companion but augusta i believe with her own goodwill would never stir beyond the park paling . many a time has she said so and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion . i think on the contrary when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very bad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little . i perfectly understand your situation however miss woodhouse looking towards mr .  woodhouse your fathers state of health must be a great drawback . why does not he try bathindeed he should . let me recommend bath to you . i assure you i have no doubt of its doing mr .  woodhouse good . my father tried it more than once formerly but without receiving any benefit and mr .  perry whose name i dare say is not unknown to you does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now . ah thats a great pity for i assure you miss woodhouse where the waters do agree it is quite wonderful the relief they give . in my bath life i have seen such instances of it and it is so cheerful a place that it could not fail of being of use to mr .  woodhouses spirits which i understand are sometimes much depressed . and as to its recommendations to you i fancy i need not take much pains to dwell on them . the advantages of bath to the young are pretty generally understood . it would be a charming introduction for you who have lived so secluded a life and i could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place . a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance and my particular friend mrs .  partridge the lady i have always resided with when in bath would be most happy to shew you any attentions and would be the very person for you to go into public with . it was as much as emma could bear without being impolite . the idea of her being indebted to mrs .  elton for what was called an introductionof her going into public under the auspices of a friend of mrs .  eltonsprobably some vulgar dashing widow who with the help of a boarder just made a shift to live the dignity of miss woodhouse of hartfield was sunk indeed she restrained herself however from any of the reproofs she could have given and only thanked mrs .  elton coolly but their going to bath was quite out of the question and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father . and then to prevent farther outrage and indignation changed the subject directly . i do not ask whether you are musical mrs .  elton . upon these occasions a ladys character generally precedes her and highbury has long known that you are a superior performer . oh no indeed i must protest against any such idea . a superior performervery far from it i assure you . consider from how partial a quarter your information came . i am doatingly fond of musicpassionately fondand my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste but as to any thing else upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree . you miss woodhouse i well know play delightfully . i assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction comfort and delight to me to hear what a musical society i am got into . i absolutely cannot do without music . it is a necessary of life to me and having always been used to a very musical society both at maple grove and in bath it would have been a most serious sacrifice . i honestly said as much to mr .  e .  when he was speaking of my future home and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable and the inferiority of the house tooknowing what i had been accustomed toof course he was not wholly without apprehension . when he was speaking of it in that way i honestly said that the world i could give upparties balls playsfor i had no fear of retirement . blessed with so many resources within myself the world was not necessary to me . i could do very well without it . to those who had no resources it was a different thing but my resources made me quite independent . and as to smallersized rooms than i had been used to i really could not give it a thought . i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description . certainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove but i did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness nor were spacious apartments . but said i to be quite honest i do not think i can live without something of a musical society . i condition for nothing else but without music life would be a blank to me . we cannot suppose said emma smiling that mr .  elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical society in highbury and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of the motive . no indeed i have no doubts at all on that head . i am delighted to find myself in such a circle . i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together . i think miss woodhouse you and i must establish a musical club and have regular weekly meetings at your house or ours . will not it be a good plan if we exert ourselves i think we shall not be long in want of allies . something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me as an inducement to keep me in practice for married women you know there is a sad story against them in general . they are but too apt to give up music . but you who are so extremely fond of itthere can be no danger surely i should hope not but really when i look around among my acquaintance i tremble . selina has entirely given up musicnever touches the instrumentthough she played sweetly . and the same may be said of mrs .  jeffereysclara partridge that wasand of the two milmans now mrs .  bird and mrs .  james cooper and of more than i can enumerate . upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright . i used to be quite angry with selina but really i begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention . i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper . but every thing of that kind said emma will soon be in so regular a train well said mrs .  elton laughing we shall see . emma finding her so determined upon neglecting her music had nothing more to say and after a moments pause mrs .  elton chose another subject . we have been calling at randalls said she and found them both at home and very pleasant people they seem to be . i like them extremely . mr .  weston seems an excellent creature quite a firstrate favourite with me already i assure you . and she appears so truly goodthere is something so motherly and kindhearted about her that it wins upon one directly . she was your governess i think emma was almost too much astonished to answer but mrs .  elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on . having understood as much i was rather astonished to find her so very ladylike but she is really quite the gentlewoman . mrs .  westons manners said emma were always particularly good . their propriety simplicity and elegance would make them the safest model for any young woman . and who do you think came in while we were there emma was quite at a loss . the tone implied some old acquaintance and how could she possibly guess knightley continued mrs .  elton knightley himselfwas not it luckyfor not being within when he called the other day i had never seen him before and of course as so particular a friend of mr .  e . s i had a great curiosity . my friend knightley had been so often mentioned that i was really impatient to see him and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend . knightley is quite the gentleman . i like him very much . decidedly i think a very gentlemanlike man . happily it was now time to be gone . they were off and emma could breathe . insufferable woman was her immediate exclamation . worse than i had supposed . absolutely insufferable knightleyi could not have believed it . knightleynever seen him in her life before and call him knightleyand discover that he is a gentleman a little upstart vulgar being with her mr .  e .  and her caro sposo and her resources and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery . actually to discover that mr .  knightley is a gentleman i doubt whether he will return the compliment and discover her to be a lady . i could not have believed it and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club one would fancy we were bosom friends and mrs .  weston astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman worse and worse . i never met with her equal . much beyond my hopes . harriet is disgraced by any comparison . oh what would frank churchill say to her if he were here how angry and how diverted he would be ah there i am thinking of him directly . always the first person to be thought of how i catch myself out frank churchill comes as regularly into my mind all this ran so glibly through her thoughts that by the time her father had arranged himself after the bustle of the eltons departure and was ready to speak she was very tolerably capable of attending . well my dear he deliberately began considering we never saw her before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady and i dare say she was very much pleased with you . she speaks a little too quick . a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear . but i believe i am nice i do not like strange voices and nobody speaks like you and poor miss taylor . however she seems a very obliging prettybehaved young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife . though i think he had better not have married . i made the best excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs .  elton on this happy occasion i said that i hoped i should in the course of the summer . but i ought to have gone before . not to wait upon a bride is very remiss . ah it shews what a sad invalid i am but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane . i dare say your apologies were accepted sir . mr .  elton knows you . yes but a young ladya bridei ought to have paid my respects to her if possible . it was being very deficient . but my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride it ought to be no recommendation to you . it is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them . no my dear i never encouraged any body to marry but i would always wish to pay every proper attention to a ladyand a bride especially is never to be neglected . more is avowedly due to her . a bride you know my dear is always the first in company let the others be who they may . well papa if this is not encouragement to marry i do not know what is . and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanitybaits for poor young ladies . my dear you do not understand me . this is a matter of mere common politeness and goodbreeding and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry . emma had done . her father was growing nervous and could not understand her . her mind returned to mrs .  eltons offences and long very long did they occupy her . chapter xv emma was not required by any subsequent discovery to retract her ill opinion of mrs .  elton . her observation had been pretty correct . such as mrs .  elton appeared to her on this second interview such she appeared whenever they met againselfimportant presuming familiar ignorant and illbred . she had a little beauty and a little accomplishment but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood and conceived miss hawkins to have held such a place in society as mrs .  eltons consequence only could surpass . there was no reason to suppose mr .  elton thought at all differently from his wife . he seemed not merely happy with her but proud . he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highbury as not even miss woodhouse could equal and the greater part of her new acquaintance disposed to commend or not in the habit of judging following the lead of miss batess goodwill or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself were very well satisfied so that mrs .  eltons praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do unimpeded by miss woodhouse who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being very pleasant and very elegantly dressed . in one respect mrs .  elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first . her feelings altered towards emma . offended probably by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant and though the effect was agreeable the illwill which produced it was necessarily increasing emmas dislike . her manners tooand mr .  eltons were unpleasant towards harriet . they were sneering and negligent . emma hoped it must rapidly work harriets cure but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much . it was not to be doubted that poor harriets attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve and her own share in the story under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him had in all likelihood been given also . she was of course the object of their joint dislike . when they had nothing else to say it must be always easy to begin abusing miss woodhouse and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of harriet . mrs .  elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax and from the first . not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other but from the very first and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration but without solicitation or plea or privilege she must be wanting to assist and befriend her . before emma had forfeited her confidence and about the third time of their meeting she heard all mrs .  eltons knighterrantry on the subject . jane fairfax is absolutely charming miss woodhouse . i quite rave about jane fairfax . a sweet interesting creature . so mild and ladylikeand with such talentsi assure you i think she has very extraordinary talents . i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well . i know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point . oh she is absolutely charming you will laugh at my warmthbut upon my word i talk of nothing but jane fairfax . and her situation is so calculated to affect onemiss woodhouse we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her . we must bring her forward . such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown . i dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its fragrance on the desert air . we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax . i cannot think there is any danger of it was emmas calm answer and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfaxs situation and understand what her home has been with colonel and mrs .  campbell i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown . oh but dear miss woodhouse she is now in such retirement such obscurity so thrown away . whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end and i think she feels it . i am sure she does . she is very timid and silent . one can see that she feels the want of encouragement . i like her the better for it . i must confess it is a recommendation to me . i am a great advocate for timidityand i am sure one does not often meet with it . but in those who are at all inferior it is extremely prepossessing . oh i assure you jane fairfax is a very delightful character and interests me more than i can express . you appear to feel a great dealbut i am not aware how you or any of miss fairfaxs acquaintance here any of those who have known her longer than yourself can shew her any other attention than my dear miss woodhouse a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act . you and i need not be afraid . if we set the example many will follow it as far as they can though all have not our situations . we have carriages to fetch and convey her home and we live in a style which could not make the addition of jane fairfax at any time the least inconvenient . i should be extremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner as could make me regret having asked more than jane fairfax to partake of it . i have no idea of that sort of thing . it is not likely that i should considering what i have been used to . my greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense . maple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be for we do not at all affect to equal my brother mr .  suckling in income . however my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax . i shall certainly have her very often at my house shall introduce her wherever i can shall have musical parties to draw out her talents and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation . my acquaintance is so very extensive that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly . i shall introduce her of course very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us . i am sure they will like her extremely and when she gets a little acquainted with them her fears will completely wear off for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating . i shall have her very often indeed while they are with me and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouchelandau in some of our exploring parties . poor jane fairfaxthought emma . you have not deserved this . you may have done wrong with regard to mr .  dixon but this is a punishment beyond what you can have meritedthe kindness and protection of mrs .  eltonjane fairfax and jane fairfax . heavens let me not suppose that she dares go about emma woodhouseing me but upon my honour there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that womans tongue emma had not to listen to such paradings againto any so exclusively addressed to herselfso disgustingly decorated with a dear miss woodhouse . the change on mrs .  eltons side soon afterwards appeared and she was left in peaceneither forced to be the very particular friend of mrs .  elton nor under mrs .  eltons guidance the very active patroness of jane fairfax and only sharing with others in a general way in knowing what was felt what was meditated what was done . she looked on with some amusement . miss batess gratitude for mrs .  eltons attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth . she was quite one of her worthies the most amiable affable delightful womanjust as accomplished and condescending as mrs .  elton meant to be considered . emmas only surprize was that jane fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate mrs .  elton as she seemed to do . she heard of her walking with the eltons sitting with the eltons spending a day with the eltons this was astonishingshe could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of miss fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the vicarage had to offer . she is a riddle quite a riddle said she . to chuse to remain here month after month under privations of every sort and now to chuse the mortification of mrs .  eltons notice and the penury of her conversation rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real generous affection . jane had come to highbury professedly for three months the campbells were gone to ireland for three months but now the campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there . according to miss batesit all came from hermrs . dixon had written most pressingly . would jane but go means were to be found servants sent friends contrivedno travelling difficulty allowed to exist but still she had declined it she must have some motive more powerful than appears for refusing this invitation was emmas conclusion . she must be under some sort of penance inflicted either by the campbells or herself . there is great fear great caution great resolution somewhere . she is not to be with the dixons . the decree is issued by somebody . but why must she consent to be with the eltonshere is quite a separate puzzle . upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject before the few who knew her opinion of mrs .  elton mrs .  weston ventured this apology for jane . we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage my dear emmabut it is better than being always at home . her aunt is a good creature but as a constant companion must be very tiresome . we must consider what miss fairfax quits before we condemn her taste for what she goes to . you are right mrs .  weston said mr .  knightley warmly miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs .  elton . could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen her . but with a reproachful smile at emma she receives attentions from mrs .  elton which nobody else pays her . emma felt that mrs .  weston was giving her a momentary glance and she was herself struck by his warmth . with a faint blush she presently replied such attentions as mrs .  eltons i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax . mrs .  eltons invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting . i should not wonder said mrs .  weston if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunts eagerness in accepting mrs .  eltons civilities for her . poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change . both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again and after a few minutes silence he said another thing must be taken into consideration toomrs . elton does not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her . we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other a something more early implanted . we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before . we feel things differently . and besides the operation of this as a general principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs .  elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that face to face mrs .  elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to . such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs .  eltons way beforeand no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness . i know how highly you think of jane fairfax said emma . little henry was in her thoughts and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say . yes he replied any body may know how highly i think of her . and yet said emma beginning hastily and with an arch look but soon stoppingit was better however to know the worst at once she hurried onand yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is . the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other . mr .  knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters and either the exertion of getting them together or some other cause brought the colour into his face as he answered oh are you therebut you are miserably behindhand . mr .  cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago . he stopped . emma felt her foot pressed by mrs .  weston and did not herself know what to think . in a moment he went on that will never be however i can assure you . miss fairfax i dare say would not have me if i were to ask herand i am very sure i shall never ask her . emma returned her friends pressure with interest and was pleased enough to exclaim you are not vain mr .  knightley . i will say that for you . he seemed hardly to hear her he was thoughtfuland in a manner which shewed him not pleased soon afterwards said so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax no indeed i have not . you have scolded me too much for matchmaking for me to presume to take such a liberty with you . what i said just now meant nothing . one says those sort of things of course without any idea of a serious meaning . oh no upon my word i have not the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body . you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married . mr .  knightley was thoughtful again . the result of his reverie was no emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize . i never had a thought of her in that way i assure you . and soon afterwards jane fairfax is a very charming young womanbut not even jane fairfax is perfect . she has a fault . she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife . emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault . well said she and you soon silenced mr .  cole i suppose yes very soon . he gave me a quiet hint i told him he was mistaken he asked my pardon and said no more . cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours . in that respect how unlike dear mrs .  elton who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world i wonder how she speaks of the coles what she calls them how can she find any appellation for them deep enough in familiar vulgarity she calls you knightleywhat can she do for mr .  cole and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her . mrs .  weston your argument weighs most with me . i can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfaxs mind over mrs .  elton . i have no faith in mrs .  eltons acknowledging herself the inferior in thought word or deed or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of goodbreeding . i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouchelandau . jane fairfax has feeling said mr .  knightleyi do not accuse her of want of feeling . her sensibilities i suspect are strongand her temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience selfcontroul but it wants openness . she is reserved more reserved i think than she used to beand i love an open temper . notill cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head . i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure alwaysbut with no thought beyond . well mrs .  weston said emma triumphantly when he left them what do you say now to mr .  knightleys marrying jane fairfax why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last . do not beat me . chapter xvi every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr .  elton was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage . dinnerparties and eveningparties were made for him and his lady and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day . i see how it is said she . i see what a life i am to lead among you . upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated . we really seem quite the fashion . if this is living in the country it is nothing very formidable . from monday next to saturday i assure you we have not a disengaged daya woman with fewer resources than i have need not have been at a loss . no invitation came amiss to her . her bath habits made eveningparties perfectly natural to her and maple grove had given her a taste for dinners . she was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms at the poor attempt at routcakes and there being no ice in the highbury cardparties . mrs .  bates mrs .  perry mrs .  goddard and others were a good deal behindhand in knowledge of the world but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged . in the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior partyin which her cardtables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true styleand more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour and in the proper order . emma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied without a dinner at hartfield for the eltons . they must not do less than others or she should be exposed to odious suspicions and imagined capable of pitiful resentment . a dinner there must be . after emma had talked about it for ten minutes mr .  woodhouse felt no unwillingness and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him . the persons to be invited required little thought . besides the eltons it must be the westons and mr .  knightley so far it was all of course and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must be asked to make the eighthbut this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction and on many accounts emma was particularly pleased by harriets begging to be allowed to decline it . she would rather not be in his company more than she could help . she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together without feeling uncomfortable . if miss woodhouse would not be displeased she would rather stay at home . it was precisely what emma would have wished had she deemed it possible enough for wishing . she was delighted with the fortitude of her little friendfor fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth jane fairfax . since her last conversation with mrs .  weston and mr .  knightley she was more consciencestricken about jane fairfax than she had often been . mr . knightleys words dwelt with her . he had said that jane fairfax received attentions from mrs .  elton which nobody else paid her . this is very true said she at least as far as relates to me which was all that was meantand it is very shameful . of the same age and always knowing heri ought to have been more her friend . she will never like me now . i have neglected her too long . but i will shew her greater attention than i have done . every invitation was successful . they were all disengaged and all happy . the preparatory interest of this dinner however was not yet over . a circumstance rather unlucky occurred . the two eldest little knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring and their papa now proposed bringing them and staying one whole day at hartfieldwhich one day would be the very day of this party . his professional engagements did not allow of his being put off but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so . mr .  woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear and here would be a ninthand emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to hartfield for fortyeight hours without falling in with a dinnerparty . she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself by representing that though he certainly would make them nine yet he always said so little that the increase of noise would be very immaterial . she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother . the event was more favourable to mr .  woodhouse than to emma . john knightley came but mr .  weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day . he might be able to join them in the evening but certainly not to dinner . mr .  woodhouse was quite at ease and the seeing him so with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate removed the chief of even emmas vexation . the day came the party were punctually assembled and mr .  john knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable . instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner he was talking to miss fairfax . mrs .  elton as elegant as lace and pearls could make her he looked at in silence wanting only to observe enough for isabellas informationbut miss fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl and he could talk to her . he had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys when it had been just beginning to rain . it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject and he said i hope you did not venture far miss fairfax this morning or i am sure you must have been wet . we scarcely got home in time . i hope you turned directly . i went only to the postoffice said she and reached home before the rain was much . it is my daily errand . i always fetch the letters when i am here . it saves trouble and is a something to get me out . a walk before breakfast does me good . not a walk in the rain i should imagine . no but it did not absolutely rain when i set out . mr .  john knightley smiled and replied that is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before . the postoffice has a great charm at one period of our lives . when you have lived to my age you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for . there was a little blush and then this answer i must not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of every dearest connexion and therefore i cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters . indifferent oh noi never conceived you could become indifferent . letters are no matter of indifference they are generally a very positive curse . you are speaking of letters of business mine are letters of friendship . i have often thought them the worst of the two replied he coolly . business you know may bring money but friendship hardly ever does . ah you are not serious now . i know mr .  john knightley too well i am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body . i can easily believe that letters are very little to you much less than to me but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference it is not age but situation . you have every body dearest to you always at hand i probably never shall again and therefore till i have outlived all my affections a postoffice i think must always have power to draw me out in worse weather than today . when i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years said john knightley i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings . i consider one as including the other . time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circlebut that is not the change i had in view for you . as an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have . it was kindly said and very far from giving offence . a pleasant thank you seemed meant to laugh it off but a blush a quivering lip a tear in the eye shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh . her attention was now claimed by mr .  woodhouse who being according to his custom on such occasions making the circle of his guests and paying his particular compliments to the ladies was ending with herand with all his mildest urbanity said i am very sorry to hear miss fairfax of your being out this morning in the rain . young ladies should take care of themselves . young ladies are delicate plants . they should take care of their health and their complexion . my dear did you change your stockings yes sir i did indeed and i am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me . my dear miss fairfax young ladies are very sure to be cared for . i hope your good grandmama and aunt are well . they are some of my very old friends . i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour . you do us a great deal of honour today i am sure . my daughter and i are both highly sensible of your goodness and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield . the kindhearted polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty and made every fair lady welcome and easy . by this time the walk in the rain had reached mrs .  elton and her remonstrances now opened upon jane . my dear jane what is this i heargoing to the postoffice in the rainthis must not be i assure you . you sad girl how could you do such a thingit is a sign i was not there to take care of you . jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold . oh do not tell me . you really are a very sad girl and do not know how to take care of yourself . to the postoffice indeed mrs .  weston did you ever hear the like you and i must positively exert our authority . my advice said mrs .  weston kindly and persuasively i certainly do feel tempted to give . miss fairfax you must not run such risks . liable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought to be particularly careful especially at this time of year . the spring i always think requires more than common care . better wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough again . now do not you feel that you had yes i am sure you are much too reasonable . you look as if you would not do such a thing again . oh she shall not do such a thing again eagerly rejoined mrs .  elton . we will not allow her to do such a thing again and nodding significantlythere must be some arrangement made there must indeed . i shall speak to mr .  e .  the man who fetches our letters every morning one of our men i forget his name shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you . that will obviate all difficulties you know and from us i really think my dear jane you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation . you are extremely kind said jane but i cannot give up my early walk . i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can i must walk somewhere and the postoffice is an object and upon my word i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before . my dear jane say no more about it . the thing is determined that is laughing affectedly as far as i can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master . you know mrs .  weston you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves . but i do flatter myself my dear jane that my influence is not entirely worn out . if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore consider that point as settled . excuse me said jane earnestly i cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement so needlessly troublesome to your servant . if the errand were not a pleasure to me it could be done as it always is when i am not here by my grandmamas . oh my dear but so much as patty has to doand it is a kindness to employ our men . jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered but instead of answering she began speaking again to mr .  john knightley . the postoffice is a wonderful establishment said she . the regularity and despatch of it if one thinks of all that it has to do and all that it does so well it is really astonishing it is certainly very well regulated . so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears so seldom that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrongand not one in a million i suppose actually lost and when one considers the variety of hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder . the clerks grow expert from habit . they must begin with some quickness of sight and hand and exercise improves them . if you want any farther explanation continued he smiling they are paid for it . that is the key to a great deal of capacity . the public pays and must be served well . the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of and the usual observations made . i have heard it asserted said john knightley that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough . but for that reason i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can get . isabella and emma i think do write very much alike . i have not always known their writing apart . yes said his brother hesitatingly there is a likeness . i know what you meanbut emmas hand is the strongest . isabella and emma both write beautifully said mr .  woodhouse and always did . and so does poor mrs .  westonwith half a sigh and half a smile at her . i never saw any gentlemans handwritingemma began looking also at mrs .  weston but stopped on perceiving that mrs .  weston was attending to some one elseand the pause gave her time to reflect now how am i going to introduce himam i unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phraseyour yorkshire friend your correspondent in yorkshirethat would be the way i suppose if i were very bad . no i can pronounce his name without the smallest distress . i certainly get better and better . now for it . mrs .  weston was disengaged and emma began againmr . frank churchill writes one of the best gentlemans hands i ever saw . i do not admire it said mr .  knightley . it is too small wants strength . it is like a womans writing . this was not submitted to by either lady . they vindicated him against the base aspersion . no it by no means wanted strength it was not a large hand but very clear and certainly strong . had not mrs .  weston any letter about her to produce no she had heard from him very lately but having answered the letter had put it away . if we were in the other room said emma if i had my writingdesk i am sure i could produce a specimen . i have a note of his . do not you remember mrs .  weston employing him to write for you one day he chose to say he was employed well well i have that note and can shew it after dinner to convince mr .  knightley . oh when a gallant young man like mr .  frank churchill said mr .  knightley dryly writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse he will of course put forth his best . dinner was on table . mrs . elton before she could be spoken to was ready and before mr .  woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the diningparlour was saying must i go first i really am ashamed of always leading the way . janes solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma . she had heard and seen it all and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any . she suspected that it had that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear and that it had not been in vain . she thought there was an air of greater happiness than usuala glow both of complexion and spirits . she could have made an inquiry or two as to the expedition and the expense of the irish mailsit was at her tongues end but she abstained . she was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt jane fairfaxs feelings and they followed the other ladies out of the room arm in arm with an appearance of goodwill highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each . chapter xvii when the ladies returned to the drawingroom after dinner emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs .  elton engross jane fairfax and slight herself . she and mrs .  weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together . mrs .  elton left them no choice . if jane repressed her for a little time she soon began again and though much that passed between them was in a halfwhisper especially on mrs .  eltons side there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects the postofficecatching coldfetching lettersand friendship were long under discussion and to them succeeded one which must be at least equally unpleasant to janeinquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her and professions of mrs .  eltons meditated activity . here is april come said she i get quite anxious about you . june will soon be here . but i have never fixed on june or any other monthmerely looked forward to the summer in general . but have you really heard of nothing i have not even made any inquiry i do not wish to make any yet . oh my dear we cannot begin too early you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing . i not aware said jane shaking her head dear mrs .  elton who can have thought of it as i have done but you have not seen so much of the world as i have . you do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations . i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove . a cousin of mr .  suckling mrs .  bragge had such an infinity of applications every body was anxious to be in her family for she moves in the first circle . waxcandles in the schoolroom you may imagine how desirable of all houses in the kingdom mrs .  bragges is the one i would most wish to see you in . colonel and mrs .  campbell are to be in town again by midsummer said jane . i must spend some time with them i am sure they will want itafterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself . but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present . trouble aye i know your scruples . you are afraid of giving me trouble but i assure you my dear jane the campbells can hardly be more interested about you than i am . i shall write to mrs .  partridge in a day or two and shall give her a strict charge to be on the lookout for any thing eligible . thank you but i would rather you did not mention the subject to her till the time draws nearer i do not wish to be giving any body trouble . but my dear child the time is drawing near here is april and june or say even july is very near with such business to accomplish before us . your inexperience really amuses me a situation such as you deserve and your friends would require for you is no everyday occurrence is not obtained at a moments notice indeed indeed we must begin inquiring directly . excuse me maam but this is by no means my intention i make no inquiry myself and should be sorry to have any made by my friends . when i am quite determined as to the time i am not at all afraid of being long unemployed . there are places in town offices where inquiry would soon produce somethingoffices for the sale not quite of human fleshbut of human intellect . oh my dear human flesh you quite shock me if you mean a fling at the slavetrade i assure you mr .  suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition . i did not mean i was not thinking of the slavetrade replied jane governesstrade i assure you was all that i had in view widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on but as to the greater misery of the victims i do not know where it lies . but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices and that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do . something that would do repeated mrs .  elton . aye that may suit your humble ideas of yourselfi know what a modest creature you are but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation in a family not moving in a certain circle or able to command the elegancies of life . you are very obliging but as to all that i am very indifferent it would be no object to me to be with the rich my mortifications i think would only be the greater i should suffer more from comparison . a gentlemans family is all that i should condition for . i know you i know you you would take up with any thing but i shall be a little more nice and i am sure the good campbells will be quite on my side with your superior talents you have a right to move in the first circle . your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms have as many rooms as you like and mix in the family as much as you chosethat isi do not know if you knew the harp you might do all that i am very sure but you sing as well as playyes i really believe you might even without the harp stipulate for what you choseand you must and shall be delightfully honourably and comfortably settled before the campbells or i have any rest . you may well class the delight the honour and the comfort of such a situation together said jane they are pretty sure to be equal however i am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me . i am exceedingly obliged to you mrs .  elton i am obliged to any body who feels for me but i am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer . for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am and as i am . and i am quite serious too i assure you replied mrs .  elton gaily in resolving to be always on the watch and employing my friends to watch also that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us . in this style she ran on never thoroughly stopped by any thing till mr .  woodhouse came into the room her vanity had then a change of object and emma heard her saying in the same halfwhisper to jane here comes this dear old beau of mine i protestonly think of his gallantry in coming away before the other menwhat a dear creature he isi assure you i like him excessively . i admire all that quaint oldfashioned politeness it is much more to my taste than modern ease modern ease often disgusts me . but this good old mr .  woodhouse i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner . oh i assure you i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous . i fancy i am rather a favourite he took notice of my gown . how do you like itselinas choicehandsome i think but i do not know whether it is not overtrimmed i have the greatest dislike to the idea of being overtrimmedquite a horror of finery . i must put on a few ornaments now because it is expected of me . a bride you know must appear like a bride but my natural taste is all for simplicity a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery . but i am quite in the minority i believe few people seem to value simplicity of dressshow and finery are every thing . i have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin . do you think it will look well the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawingroom when mr .  weston made his appearance among them . he had returned to a late dinner and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over . he had been too much expected by the best judges for surprize but there was great joy . mr .  woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now as he would have been sorry to see him before . john knightley only was in mute astonishment . that a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in london should set off again and walk half a mile to another mans house for the sake of being in mixed company till bedtime of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers was a circumstance to strike him deeply . a man who had been in motion since eight oclock in the morning and might now have been still who had been long talking and might have been silent who had been in more than one crowd and might have been alonesuch a man to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside and on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into the worldcould he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife there would have been a motive but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party . john knightley looked at him with amazement then shrugged his shoulders and said i could not have believed it even of him . mr .  weston meanwhile perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting happy and cheerful as usual and with all the right of being principal talker which a day spent anywhere from home confers was making himself agreeable among the rest and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten and spread abroad what public news he had heard was proceeding to a family communication which though principally addressed to mrs .  weston he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room . he gave her a letter it was from frank and to herself he had met with it in his way and had taken the liberty of opening it . read it read it said he it will give you pleasure only a few lineswill not take you long read it to emma . the two ladies looked over it together and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time in a voice a little subdued but very audible to every body . well he is coming you see good news i think . well what do you say to iti always told you he would be here again soon did not ianne my dear did not i always tell you so and you would not believe mein town next week you seeat the latest i dare say for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done most likely they will be there tomorrow or saturday . as to her illness all nothing of course . but it is an excellent thing to have frank among us again so near as town . they will stay a good while when they do come and he will be half his time with us . this is precisely what i wanted . well pretty good news is not it have you finished it has emma read it all put it up put it up we will have a good talk about it some other time but it will not do now . i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way . mrs .  weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion . her looks and words had nothing to restrain them . she was happy she knew she was happy and knew she ought to be happy . her congratulations were warm and open but emma could not speak so fluently . she was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings and trying to understand the degree of her agitation which she rather thought was considerable . mr .  weston however too eager to be very observant too communicative to want others to talk was very well satisfied with what she did say and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already . it was well that he took every bodys joy for granted or he might not have thought either mr .  woodhouse or mr .  knightley particularly delighted . they were the first entitled after mrs .  weston and emma to be made happyfrom them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax but she was so deep in conversation with john knightley that it would have been too positive an interruption and finding himself close to mrs .  elton and her attention disengaged he necessarily began on the subject with her . chapter xviii i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you said mr .  weston . mrs .  elton very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope smiled most graciously . you have heard of a certain frank churchill i presume he continued and know him to be my son though he does not bear my name . oh yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance . i am sure mr .  elton will lose no time in calling on him and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage . you are very obliging . frank will be extremely happy i am sure . he is to be in town next week if not sooner . we have notice of it in a letter today . i met the letters in my way this morning and seeing my sons hand presumed to open itthough it was not directed to meit was to mrs .  weston . she is his principal correspondent i assure you . i hardly ever get a letter . and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her oh mr .  weston laughing affectedly i must protest against that . a most dangerous precedent indeedi beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example . upon my word if this is what i am to expect we married women must begin to exert ourselvesoh mr .  weston i could not have believed it of you aye we men are sad fellows . you must take care of yourself mrs .  elton . this letter tells usit is a short letterwritten in a hurry merely to give us noticeit tells us that they are all coming up to town directly on mrs .  churchills accountshe has not been well the whole winter and thinks enscombe too cold for her so they are all to move southward without loss of time . indeedfrom yorkshire i think . enscombe is in yorkshire yes they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london . a considerable journey . yes upon my word very considerable . sixtyfive miles farther than from maple grove to london . but what is distance mr .  weston to people of large fortuneyou would be amazed to hear how my brother mr .  suckling sometimes flies about . you will hardly believe me but twice in one week he and mr .  bragge went to london and back again with four horses . the evil of the distance from enscombe said mr .  weston is that mrs .  churchill as we understand has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together . in franks last letter she complained he said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncles this you know speaks a great degree of weaknessbut now she is so impatient to be in town that she means to sleep only two nights on the road . so frank writes word . certainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions mrs .  elton . you must grant me that . no indeed i shall grant you nothing . i always take the part of my own sex . i do indeed . i give you noticeyou will find me a formidable antagonist on that point . i always stand up for women and i assure you if you knew how selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn you would not wonder at mrs .  churchills making incredible exertions to avoid it . selina says it is quite horror to herand i believe i have caught a little of her nicety . she always travels with her own sheets an excellent precaution . does mrs .  churchill do the same depend upon it mrs .  churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did . mrs .  churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for mrs .  elton eagerly interposed with oh mr .  weston do not mistake me . selina is no fine lady i assure you . do not run away with such an idea . is not she then she is no rule for mrs .  churchill who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld . mrs .  elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly . it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was not a fine lady perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of itand she was considering in what way she had best retract when mr .  weston went on . mrs .  churchill is not much in my good graces as you may suspect but this is quite between ourselves . she is very fond of frank and therefore i would not speak ill of her . besides she is out of health now but that indeed by her own account she has always been . i would not say so to every body mrs .  elton but i have not much faith in mrs .  churchills illness . if she is really ill why not go to bath mr .  westonto bath or to clifton she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too cold for her . the fact is i suppose that she is tired of enscombe . she has now been a longer time stationary there than she ever was before and she begins to want change . it is a retired place . a fine place but very retired . ayelike maple grove i dare say . nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove . such an immense plantation all round it you seem shut out from every thingin the most complete retirement . and mrs .  churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion . or perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life . i always say a woman cannot have too many resourcesand i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society . frank was here in february for a fortnight . so i remember to have heard . he will find an addition to the society of highbury when he comes again that is if i may presume to call myself an addition . but perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world . this was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by and mr .  weston with a very good grace immediately exclaimed my dear madam nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible . not heard of youi believe mrs .  westons letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs .  elton . he had done his duty and could return to his son . when frank left us continued he it was quite uncertain when we might see him again which makes this days news doubly welcome . it has been completely unexpected . that is i always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon i was sure something favourable would turn upbut nobody believed me . he and mrs .  weston were both dreadfully desponding . how could he contrive to come and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again and so forthi always felt that something would happen in our favour and so it has you see . i have observed mrs .  elton in the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next . very true mr .  weston perfectly true . it is just what i used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship when because things did not go quite right did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings he was apt to be in despair and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be may before hymens saffron robe would be put on for us . oh the pains i have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views the carriagewe had disappointments about the carriageone morning i remember he came to me quite in despair . she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing and mr .  weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on . you were mentioning may . may is the very month which mrs .  churchill is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place than enscombein short to spend in london so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it days almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant always inviting one out and never too hot for exercise . when he was here before we made the best of it but there was a good deal of wet damp cheerless weather there always is in february you know and we could not do half that we intended . now will be the time . this will be complete enjoyment and i do not know mrs .  elton whether the uncertainty of our meetings the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in today or tomorrow and at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house . i think it is so . i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight . i hope you will be pleased with my son but you must not expect a prodigy . he is generally thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy . mrs .  westons partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose most gratifying to me . she thinks nobody equal to him . and i assure you mr .  weston i have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour . i have heard so much in praise of mr .  frank churchill . at the same time it is fair to observe that i am one of those who always judge for themselves and are by no means implicitly guided by others . i give you notice that as i find your son so i shall judge of him . i am no flatterer . mr .  weston was musing . i hope said he presently i have not been severe upon poor mrs .  churchill . if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish . you cannot be ignorant mrs .  elton of my connexion with the family nor of the treatment i have met with and between ourselves the whole blame of it is to be laid to her . she was the instigator . franks mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her . mr .  churchill has pride but his pride is nothing to his wifes his is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome but her pride is arrogance and insolence and what inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood . she was nobody when he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman but ever since her being turned into a churchill she has outchurchilld them all in high and mighty claims but in herself i assure you she is an upstart . only think well that must be infinitely provoking i have quite a horror of upstarts . maple grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves your description of mrs .  churchill made me think of them directly . people of the name of tupman very lately settled there and encumbered with many low connexions but giving themselves immense airs and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families . a year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at west hall and how they got their fortune nobody knows . they came from birmingham which is not a place to promise much you know mr .  weston . one has not great hopes from birmingham . i always say there is something direful in the sound but nothing more is positively known of the tupmans though a good many things i assure you are suspected and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother mr .  suckling who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours . it is infinitely too bad . mr .  suckling who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove and whose father had it before himi believe at leasti am almost sure that old mr .  suckling had completed the purchase before his death . they were interrupted . tea was carrying round and mr .  weston having said all that he wanted soon took the opportunity of walking away . after tea mr .  and mrs .  weston and mr .  elton sat down with mr .  woodhouse to cards . the remaining five were left to their own powers and emma doubted their getting on very well for mr .  knightley seemed little disposed for conversation mrs .  elton was wanting notice which nobody had inclination to pay and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent . mr .  john knightley proved more talkative than his brother . he was to leave them early the next day and he soon began with well emma i do not believe i have any thing more to say about the boys but you have your sisters letter and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure . my charge would be much more concise than hers and probably not much in the same spirit all that i have to recommend being comprised in do not spoil them and do not physic them . i rather hope to satisfy you both said emma for i shall do all in my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic . and if you find them troublesome you must send them home again . that is very likely . you think so do not you i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father or even may be some encumbrance to you if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately . increase certainly you must be sensible that the last halfyear has made a great difference in your way of life . difference no indeed i am not . there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be . witness this very time . here am i come down for only one day and you are engaged with a dinnerparty when did it happen before or any thing like it your neighbourhood is increasing and you mix more with it . a little while ago every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties dinners at mr .  coles or balls at the crown . the difference which randalls randalls alone makes in your goingson is very great . yes said his brother quickly it is randalls that does it all . very welland as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less influence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma that henry and john may be sometimes in the way . and if they are i only beg you to send them home . no cried mr .  knightley that need not be the consequence . let them be sent to donwell . i shall certainly be at leisure . upon my word exclaimed emma you amuse me i should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys . these amazing engagements of mine what have they been dining once with the colesand having a ball talked of which never took place . i can understand younodding at mr .  john knightleyyour good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed . but you turning to mr .  knightley who know how very very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me i cannot imagine . and as to my dear little boys i must say that if aunt emma has not time for them i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one and who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling his accounts . mr .  knightley seemed to be trying not to smile and succeeded without difficulty upon mrs .  eltons beginning to talk to him . a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill . she was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed it was for him . her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing it was not worth thinking of but if he who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away it would be very distressing . if a separation of two months should not have cooled him there were dangers and evils before hercaution for him and for herself would be necessary . she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his . she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration . that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance and yet she could not help rather anticipating something decisive . she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis an event a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state . it was not very long though rather longer than mr .  weston had foreseen before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchills feelings . the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined but he was at highbury very soon afterwards . he rode down for a couple of hours he could not yet do more but as he came from randalls immediately to hartfield she could then exercise all her quick observation and speedily determine how he was influenced and how she must act . they met with the utmost friendliness . there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her . but she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree . she watched him well . it was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been . absence with the conviction probably of her indifference had produced this very natural and very desirable effect . he was in high spirits as ready to talk and laugh as ever and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit and recur to old stories and he was not without agitation . it was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference . he was not calm his spirits were evidently fluttered there was restlessness about him . lively as he was it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself but what decided her belief on the subject was his staying only a quarter of an hour and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury . he had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed he had not stopped he would not stop for more than a wordbut he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call and much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield he must hurry off . she had no doubt as to his being less in lovebut neither his agitated spirits nor his hurrying away seemed like a perfect cure and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long . this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days . he was often hoping intending to comebut was always prevented . his aunt could not bear to have him leave her . such was his own account at randalls . if he were quite sincere if he really tried to come it was to be inferred that mrs .  churchills removal to london had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder . that she was really ill was very certain he had declared himself convinced of it at randalls . though much might be fancy he could not doubt when he looked back that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago . he did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her but he could not be prevailed on by all his fathers doubts to say that her complaints were merely imaginary or that she was as strong as ever . it soon appeared that london was not the place for her . she could not endure its noise . her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering and by the ten days end her nephews letter to randalls communicated a change of plan . they were going to remove immediately to richmond . mrs .  churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there and had otherwise a fancy for the place . a readyfurnished house in a favourite spot was engaged and much benefit expected from the change . emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends for the house was taken for may and june . she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them almost as often as he could even wish . emma saw how mr .  weston understood these joyous prospects . he was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered . she hoped it was not so . two months must bring it to the proof . mr .  westons own happiness was indisputable . he was quite delighted . it was the very circumstance he could have wished for . now it would be really having frank in their neighbourhood . what were nine miles to a young manan hours ride . he would be always coming over . the difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never . sixteen milesnay eighteenit must be full eighteen to manchesterstreetwas a serious obstacle . were he ever able to get away the day would be spent in coming and returning . there was no comfort in having him in london he might as well be at enscombe but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse . better than nearer one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal the ball at the crown . it had not been forgotten before but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day . now however it was absolutely to be every preparation was resumed and very soon after the churchills had removed to richmond a few lines from frank to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twentyfour hours at any given time induced them to name as early a day as possible . mr .  westons ball was to be a real thing . a very few tomorrows stood between the young people of highbury and happiness . mr .  woodhouse was resigned . the time of year lightened the evil to him . may was better for every thing than february . mrs .  bates was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield james had due notice and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear little john would have any thing the matter with them while dear emma were gone . chapter ii no misfortune occurred again to prevent the ball . the day approached the day arrived and after a morning of some anxious watching frank churchill in all the certainty of his own self reached randalls before dinner and every thing was safe . no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma . the room at the crown was to witness itbut it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd . mr .  weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came that she could not refuse him and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young mans company . she was to convey harriet and they drove to the crown in good time the randalls party just sufficiently before them . frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch and though he did not say much his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening . they all walked about together to see that every thing was as it should be and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage which emma could not hear the sound of at first without great surprize . so unreasonably early she was going to exclaim but she presently found that it was a family of old friends who were coming like herself by particular desire to help mr .  westons judgment and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness on the same errand that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection . emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which mr .  weston depended and felt that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity . she liked his open manners but a little less of openheartedness would have made him a higher character . general benevolence but not general friendship made a man what he ought to be . she could fancy such a man . the whole party walked about and looked and praised again and then having nothing else to do formed a sort of halfcircle round the fire to observe in their various modes till other subjects were started that though may a fire in the evening was still very pleasant . emma found that it was not mr .  westons fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger . they had stopped at mrs .  batess door to offer the use of their carriage but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons . frank was standing by her but not steadily there was a restlessness which shewed a mind not at ease . he was looking about he was going to the door he was watching for the sound of other carriages impatient to begin or afraid of being always near her . mrs .  elton was spoken of . i think she must be here soon said he . i have a great curiosity to see mrs .  elton i have heard so much of her . it cannot be long i think before she comes . a carriage was heard . he was on the move immediately but coming back said i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her . i have never seen either mr .  or mrs .  elton . i have no business to put myself forward . mr .  and mrs .  elton appeared and all the smiles and the proprieties passed . but miss bates and miss fairfax said mr .  weston looking about . we thought you were to bring them . the mistake had been slight . the carriage was sent for them now . emma longed to know what franks first opinion of mrs .  elton might be how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress and her smiles of graciousness . he was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion by giving her very proper attention after the introduction had passed . in a few minutes the carriage returned . somebody talked of rain . i will see that there are umbrellas sir said frank to his father miss bates must not be forgotten and away he went . mr .  weston was following but mrs .  elton detained him to gratify him by her opinion of his son and so briskly did she begin that the young man himself though by no means moving slowly could hardly be out of hearing . a very fine young man indeed mr .  weston . you know i candidly told you i should form my own opinion and i am happy to say that i am extremely pleased with him . you may believe me . i never compliment . i think him a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely what i like and approveso truly the gentleman without the least conceit or puppyism . you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies quite a horror of them . they were never tolerated at maple grove . neither mr .  suckling nor me had ever any patience with them and we used sometimes to say very cutting things selina who is mild almost to a fault bore with them much better . while she talked of his son mr .  westons attention was chained but when she got to maple grove he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to and with happy smiles must hurry away . mrs .  elton turned to mrs .  weston . i have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane . our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditiousi believe we drive faster than any body . what a pleasure it is to send ones carriage for a friend i understand you were so kind as to offer but another time it will be quite unnecessary . you may be very sure i shall always take care of them . miss bates and miss fairfax escorted by the two gentlemen walked into the room and mrs .  elton seemed to think it as much her duty as mrs .  westons to receive them . her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma but her words every bodys words were soon lost under the incessant flow of miss bates who came in talking and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire . as the door opened she was heard so very obliging of youno rain at all . nothing to signify . i do not care for myself . quite thick shoes . and jane declares wellas soon as she was within the door well this is brilliant indeedthis is admirableexcellently contrived upon my word . nothing wanting .

am quite roasted . no coffee i thank you for menever take coffee . a little tea if you please sir by and byeno hurryoh here it comes . every thing so good frank churchill returned to his station by emma and as soon as miss bates was quiet she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of mrs .  elton and miss fairfax who were standing a little way behind her . he was thoughtful . whether he were overhearing too she could not determine . after a good many compliments to jane on her dress and look compliments very quietly and properly taken mrs .  elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself and it was how do you like my gownhow do you like my trimming how has wright done my hairwith many other relative questions all answered with patient politeness . mrs .  elton then said nobody can think less of dress in general than i dobut upon such an occasion as this when every bodys eyes are so much upon me and in compliment to the westonswho i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honouri would not wish to be inferior to others . and i see very few pearls in the room except mine . so frank churchill is a capital dancer i understand . we shall see if our styles suit . a fine young man certainly is frank churchill . i like him very well . at this moment frank began talking so vigorously that emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises and did not want to hear moreand the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while till another suspension brought mrs .  eltons tones again distinctly forward . mr . elton had just joined them and his wife was exclaiming oh you have found us out at last have you in our seclusion i was this moment telling jane i thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us . janerepeated frank churchill with a look of surprize and displeasure . that is easybut miss fairfax does not disapprove it i suppose . how do you like mrs .  elton said emma in a whisper . not at all . you are ungrateful . ungratefulwhat do you mean then changing from a frown to a smileno do not tell mei do not want to know what you mean . where is my fatherwhen are we to begin dancing emma could hardly understand him he seemed in an odd humour . he walked off to find his father but was quickly back again with both mr .  and mrs .  weston . he had met with them in a little perplexity which must be laid before emma . it had just occurred to mrs .  weston that mrs .  elton must be asked to begin the ball that she would expect it which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinction . emma heard the sad truth with fortitude . and what are we to do for a proper partner for her said mr .  weston . she will think frank ought to ask her . frank turned instantly to emma to claim her former promise and boasted himself an engaged man which his father looked his most perfect approbation ofand it then appeared that mrs .  weston was wanting him to dance with mrs .  elton himself and that their business was to help to persuade him into it which was done pretty soon . mr .  weston and mrs .  elton led the way mr .  frank churchill and miss woodhouse followed . emma must submit to stand second to mrs .  elton though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her . it was almost enough to make her think of marrying . mrs .  elton had undoubtedly the advantage at this time in vanity completely gratified for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill she could not lose by the change . mr .  weston might be his sons superior . in spite of this little rub however emma was smiling with enjoyment delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her . she was more disturbed by mr .  knightleys not dancing than by any thing else . there he was among the standersby where he ought not to be he ought to be dancingnot classing himself with the husbands and fathers and whistplayers who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made upso young as he looked he could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere than where he had placed himself . his tall firm upright figure among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men was such as emma felt must draw every bodys eyes and excepting her own partner there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him . he moved a few steps nearer and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner with what natural grace he must have danced would he but take the trouble . whenever she caught his eye she forced him to smile but in general he was looking grave . she wished he could love a ballroom better and could like frank churchill better . he seemed often observing her . she must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing but if he were criticising her behaviour she did not feel afraid . there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner . they seemed more like cheerful easy friends than lovers . that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done was indubitable . the ball proceeded pleasantly . the anxious cares the incessant attentions of mrs .  weston were not thrown away . every body seemed happy and the praise of being a delightful ball which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this . of very important very recordable events it was not more productive than such meetings usually are . there was one however which emma thought something of . the two last dances before supper were begun and harriet had no partnerthe only young lady sitting down and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonderbut emmas wonder lessened soon afterwards on seeing mr .  elton sauntering about . he would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided she was sure he would notand she was expecting him every moment to escape into the cardroom . escape however was not his plan . he came to the part of the room where the sittersby were collected spoke to some and walked about in front of them as if to shew his liberty and his resolution of maintaining it . he did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith or speaking to those who were close to her . emma saw it . she was not yet dancing she was working her way up from the bottom and had therefore leisure to look around and by only turning her head a little she saw it all . when she was halfway up the set the whole group were exactly behind her and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch but mr .  elton was so near that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and mrs .  weston and she perceived that his wife who was standing immediately above her was not only listening also but even encouraging him by significant glances . the kindhearted gentle mrs .  weston had left her seat to join him and say do not you dance mr .  elton to which his prompt reply was most readily mrs .  weston if you will dance with me . meoh noi would get you a better partner than myself . i am no dancer . if mrs .  gilbert wishes to dance said he i shall have great pleasure i am surefor though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man and that my dancing days are over it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs .  gilbert . mrs .  gilbert does not mean to dance but there is a young lady disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancingmiss smith . miss smithohi had not observed . you are extremely obliging and if i were not an old married man . but my dancing days are over mrs .  weston . you will excuse me . any thing else i should be most happy to do at your commandbut my dancing days are over . mrs .  weston said no more and emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat . this was mr .  elton the amiable obliging gentle mr .  elton . she looked round for a moment he had joined mr .  knightley at a little distance and was arranging himself for settled conversation while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife . she would not look again . her heart was in a glow and she feared her face might be as hot . in another moment a happier sight caught hermr . knightley leading harriet to the setnever had she been more surprized seldom more delighted than at that instant . she was all pleasure and gratitude both for harriet and herself and longed to be thanking him and though too distant for speech her countenance said much as soon as she could catch his eye again . his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it extremely good and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky if it had not been for the cruel state of things before and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced . it was not thrown away on her she bounded higher than ever flew farther down the middle and was in a continual course of smiles . mr .  elton had retreated into the cardroom looking emma trusted very foolish . she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife though growing very like hershe spoke some of her feelings by observing audibly to her partner knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smithvery goodnatured i declare . supper was announced . the move began and miss bates might be heard from that moment without interruption till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon . jane jane my dear jane where are youhere is your tippet . mrs .  weston begs you to put on your tippet . she says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage though every thing has been doneone door nailed upquantities of mattingmy dear jane indeed you must . mr .  churchill oh you are too obliging how well you put it onso gratified excellent dancing indeed yes my dear i ran home as i said i should to help grandmama to bed and got back again and nobody missed me . i set off without saying a word just as i told you . grandmama was quite well had a charming evening with mr .  woodhouse a vast deal of chat and backgammon . tea was made downstairs biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away amazing luck in some of her throws and she inquired a great deal about you how you were amused and who were your partners . oh said i i shall not forestall jane i left her dancing with mr .  george otway she will love to tell you all about it herself tomorrow her first partner was mr .  elton i do not know who will ask her next perhaps mr .  william cox . my dear sir you are too obliging . is there nobody you would not ratheri am not helpless . sir you are most kind . upon my word jane on one arm and me on the otherstop stop let us stand a little back mrs .  elton is going dear mrs .  elton how elegant she looksbeautiful lacenow we all follow in her train . quite the queen of the eveningwell here we are at the passage . two steps jane take care of the two steps . oh no there is but one . well i was persuaded there were two . how very odd i was convinced there were two and there is but one . i never saw any thing equal to the comfort and stylecandles everywhere . i was telling you of your grandmama janethere was a little disappointment . the baked apples and biscuits excellent in their way you know but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first and good mr .  woodhouse not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough sent it all out again . now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus so she was rather disappointed but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse who would be so very much concernedwell this is brilliant i am all amazement could not have supposed any thingsuch elegance and profusioni have seen nothing like it since well where shall we sit where shall we sit anywhere so that jane is not in a draught . where i sit is of no consequence . oh do you recommend this sidewell i am sure mr .  churchill only it seems too goodbut just as you please . what you direct in this house cannot be wrong . dear jane how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama soup too bless me i should not be helped so soon but it smells most excellent and i cannot help beginning . emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr .  knightley till after supper but when they were all in the ballroom again her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked . he was warm in his reprobation of mr .  eltons conduct it had been unpardonable rudeness and mrs .  eltons looks also received the due share of censure . they aimed at wounding more than harriet said he . emma why is it that they are your enemies he looked with smiling penetration and on receiving no answer added she ought not to be angry with you i suspect whatever he may be . to that surmise you say nothing of course but confess emma that you did want him to marry harriet . i did replied emma and they cannot forgive me . he shook his head but there was a smile of indulgence with it and he only said i shall not scold you . i leave you to your own reflections . can you trust me with such flatterersdoes my vain spirit ever tell me i am wrong not your vain spirit but your serious spirit . if one leads you wrong i am sure the other tells you of it . i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr .  elton . there is a littleness about him which you discovered and which i did not and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet . it was through a series of strange blunders and in return for your acknowledging so much i will do you the justice to say that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself . harriet smith has some firstrate qualities which mrs .  elton is totally without . an unpretending singleminded artless girl infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs .  elton . i found harriet more conversable than i expected . emma was extremely gratified . they were interrupted by the bustle of mr .  weston calling on every body to begin dancing again . come miss woodhouse miss otway miss fairfax what are you all doing come emma set your companions the example . every body is lazy every body is asleep i am ready said emma whenever i am wanted . whom are you going to dance with asked mr .  knightley . she hesitated a moment and then replied with you if you will ask me . will you said he offering his hand . indeed i will . you have shewn that you can dance and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper . brother and sister no indeed . chapter iii this little explanation with mr .  knightley gave emma considerable pleasure . it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy . she was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the eltons and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike and his praise of harriet his concession in her favour was peculiarly gratifying . the impertinence of the eltons which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions and she looked forward to another happy resultthe cure of harriets infatuation . from harriets manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom she had strong hopes . it seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened and she were enabled to see that mr .  elton was not the superior creature she had believed him . the fever was over and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy . she depended on the evil feelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite . harriet rational frank churchill not too much in love and mr .  knightley not wanting to quarrel with her how very happy a summer must be before her she was not to see frank churchill this morning . he had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield as he was to be at home by the middle of the day . she did not regret it . having arranged all these matters looked them through and put them all to rights she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys as well as of their grandpapa when the great iron sweepgate opened and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see togetherfrank churchill with harriet leaning on his armactually harrieta moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened . harriet looked white and frightened and he was trying to cheer her . the iron gates and the frontdoor were not twenty yards asunder they were all three soon in the hall and harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away . a young lady who faints must be recovered questions must be answered and surprizes be explained . such events are very interesting but the suspense of them cannot last long . a few minutes made emma acquainted with the whole . miss smith and miss bickerton another parlour boarder at mrs .  goddards who had been also at the ball had walked out together and taken a road the richmond road which though apparently public enough for safety had led them into alarm . about half a mile beyond highbury making a sudden turn and deeply shaded by elms on each side it became for a considerable stretch very retired and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them on a broader patch of greensward by the side a party of gipsies . a child on the watch came towards them to beg and miss bickerton excessively frightened gave a great scream and calling on harriet to follow her ran up a steep bank cleared a slight hedge at the top and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury . but poor harriet could not follow . she had suffered very much from cramp after dancing and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless and in this state and exceedingly terrified she had been obliged to remain . how the trampers might have behaved had the young ladies been more courageous must be doubtful but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted and harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children headed by a stout woman and a great boy all clamorous and impertinent in look though not absolutely in word . more and more frightened she immediately promised them money and taking out her purse gave them a shilling and begged them not to want more or to use her ill . she was then able to walk though but slowly and was moving awaybut her terror and her purse were too tempting and she was followed or rather surrounded by the whole gang demanding more . in this state frank churchill had found her she trembling and conditioning they loud and insolent . by a most fortunate chance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment . the pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward and leave his horses to meet him by another road a mile or two beyond highbury and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of miss bates and to have forgotten to restore them he had been obliged to stop at her door and go in for a few minutes he was therefore later than he had intended and being on foot was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them . the terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet was then their own portion . he had left them completely frightened and harriet eagerly clinging to him and hardly able to speak had just strength enough to reach hartfield before her spirits were quite overcome . it was his idea to bring her to hartfield he had thought of no other place . this was the amount of the whole storyof his communication and of harriets as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech . he dared not stay longer than to see her well these several delays left him not another minute to lose and emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to mrs .  goddard and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr .  knightley he set off with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself . such an adventure as thisa fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain . so emma thought at least . could a linguist could a grammarian could even a mathematician have seen what she did have witnessed their appearance together and heard their history of it without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each otherhow much more must an imaginist like herself be on fire with speculation and foresightespecially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made . it was a very extraordinary thing nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place within her memory no rencontre no alarm of the kindand now it had happened to the very person and at the very hour when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue herit certainly was very extraordinaryand knowing as she did the favourable state of mind of each at this period it struck her the more . he was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself she just recovering from her mania for mr .  elton . it seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences . it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other . in the few minutes conversation which she had yet had with him while harriet had been partially insensible he had spoken of her terror her naivete her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm with a sensibility amused and delighted and just at last after harriets own account had been given he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms . every thing was to take its natural course however neither impelled nor assisted . she would not stir a step nor drop a hint . no she had had enough of interference . there could be no harm in a scheme a mere passive scheme . it was no more than a wish . beyond it she would on no account proceed . emmas first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passedaware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible . within half an hour it was known all over highbury . it was the very event to engage those who talk most the young and the low and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news . the last nights ball seemed lost in the gipsies . poor mr .  woodhouse trembled as he sat and as emma had foreseen would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again . it was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after as well as miss smith were coming in during the rest of the day and he had the pleasure of returning for answer that they were all very indifferent which though not exactly true for she was perfectly well and harriet not much otherwise emma would not interfere with . she had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man for she hardly knew what indisposition was and if he did not invent illnesses for her she could make no figure in a message . the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice they took themselves off in a hurry . the young ladies of highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to emma and her nephewsin her imagination it maintained its ground and henry and john were still asking every day for the story of harriet and the gipsies and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital . chapter iv a very few days had passed after this adventure when harriet came one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand and after sitting down and hesitating thus began miss woodhouseif you are at leisurei have something that i should like to tell youa sort of confession to makeand then you know it will be over . emma was a good deal surprized but begged her to speak . there was a seriousness in harriets manner which prepared her quite as much as her words for something more than ordinary . it is my duty and i am sure it is my wish she continued to have no reserves with you on this subject . as i am happily quite an altered creature in one respect it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it . i do not want to say more than is necessaryi am too much ashamed of having given way as i have done and i dare say you understand me . yes said emma i hope i do . how i could so long a time be fancying myself  .  .  . cried harriet warmly . it seems like madness i can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now . i do not care whether i meet him or notexcept that of the two i had rather not see him and indeed i would go any distance round to avoid himbut i do not envy his wife in the least i neither admire her nor envy her as i have done she is very charming i dare say and all that but i think her very illtempered and disagreeablei shall never forget her look the other nighthowever i assure you miss woodhouse i wish her no evil . no let them be ever so happy together it will not give me another moments pang and to convince you that i have been speaking truth i am now going to destroywhat i ought to have destroyed long agowhat i ought never to have kept i know that very well blushing as she spoke . however now i will destroy it alland it is my particular wish to do it in your presence that you may see how rational i am grown . cannot you guess what this parcel holds said she with a conscious look . not the least in the world . did he ever give you any thing noi cannot call them gifts but they are things that i have valued very much . she held the parcel towards her and emma read the words most precious treasures on the top . her curiosity was greatly excited . harriet unfolded the parcel and she looked on with impatience . within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridgeware box which harriet opened it was well lined with the softest cotton but excepting the cotton emma saw only a small piece of courtplaister . now said harriet you must recollect . no indeed i do not . dear me i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about courtplaister one of the very last times we ever met in itit was but a very few days before i had my sore throatjust before mr .  and mrs .  john knightley came i think the very evening . do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife and your recommending courtplaister but as you had none about you and knew i had you desired me to supply him and so i took mine out and cut him a piece but it was a great deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept playing some time with what was left before he gave it back to me . and so then in my nonsense i could not help making a treasure of it so i put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then as a great treat . my dearest harriet cried emma putting her hand before her face and jumping up you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear . remember it aye i remember it all now all except your saving this relici knew nothing of that till this momentbut the cutting the finger and my recommending courtplaister and saying i had none about meoh my sins my sinsand i had plenty all the while in my pocketone of my senseless tricksi deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life . wellsitting down again go onwhat else and had you really some at hand yourself i am sure i never suspected it you did it so naturally . and so you actually put this piece of courtplaister by for his sake said emma recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement . and secretly she added to herself lord bless me when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of courtplaister that frank churchill had been pulling about i never was equal to this . here resumed harriet turning to her box again here is something still more valuable i mean that has been more valuable because this is what did really once belong to him which the courtplaister never did . emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure . it was the end of an old pencilthe part without any lead . this was really his said harriet . do not you remember one morningno i dare say you do not . but one morningi forget exactly the daybut perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before that evening he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocketbook it was about sprucebeer . mr .  knightley had been telling him something about brewing sprucebeer and he wanted to put it down but when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another and this was left upon the table as good for nothing . but i kept my eye on it and as soon as i dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment . i do remember it cried emma i perfectly remember it . talking about sprucebeer . oh yesmr . knightley and i both saying we liked it and mr .  eltons seeming resolved to learn to like it too . i perfectly remember it . stop mr .  knightley was standing just here was not he i have an idea he was standing just here . ah i do not know . i cannot recollect . it is very odd but i cannot recollect . mr . elton was sitting here i remember much about where i am now . well go on . oh thats all . i have nothing more to shew you or to say except that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire and i wish you to see me do it . my poor dear harriet and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things yes simpleton as i wasbut i am quite ashamed of it now and wish i could forget as easily as i can burn them . it was very wrong of me you know to keep any remembrances after he was married . i knew it wasbut had not resolution enough to part with them . but harriet is it necessary to burn the courtplaisteri have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the courtplaister might be useful . i shall be happier to burn it replied harriet . it has a disagreeable look to me . i must get rid of every thing . there it goes and there is an end thank heaven of mr .  elton . and when thought emma will there be a beginning of mr .  churchill she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made and could not but hope that the gipsy though she had told no fortune might be proved to have made harriets . about a fortnight after the alarm they came to a sufficient explanation and quite undesignedly . emma was not thinking of it at the moment which made the information she received more valuable . she merely said in the course of some trivial chat well harriet whenever you marry i would advise you to do so and soand thought no more of it till after a minutes silence she heard harriet say in a very serious tone i shall never marry . emma then looked up and immediately saw how it was and after a moments debate as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not replied never marrythis is a new resolution . it is one that i shall never change however . after another short hesitation i hope it does not proceed from i hope it is not in compliment to mr .  elton mr .  elton indeed cried harriet indignantly . oh noand emma could just catch the words so superior to mr .  elton she then took a longer time for consideration . should she proceed no farthershould she let it pass and seem to suspect nothing perhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did or perhaps if she were totally silent it might only drive harriet into asking her to hear too much and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances she was perfectly resolved . she believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once all that she meant to say and know . plain dealing was always best . she had previously determined how far she would proceed on any application of the sort and it would be safer for both to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed . she was decided and thus spoke harriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning . your resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you . is not it so oh miss woodhouse believe me i have not the presumption to suppose indeed i am not so mad . but it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distanceand to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration which are so proper in me especially . i am not at all surprized at you harriet . the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart . service oh it was such an inexpressible obligation the very recollection of it and all that i felt at the time when i saw him cominghis noble lookand my wretchedness before . such a change in one moment such a change from perfect misery to perfect happiness it is very natural . it is natural and it is honourable . yes honourable i think to chuse so well and so gratefully . but that it will be a fortunate preference is more that i can promise . i do not advise you to give way to it harriet . i do not by any means engage for its being returned . consider what you are about . perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can at any rate do not let them carry you far unless you are persuaded of his liking you . be observant of him . let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations . i give you this caution now because i shall never speak to you again on the subject . i am determined against all interference . henceforward i know nothing of the matter . let no name ever pass our lips . we were very wrong before we will be cautious now . he is your superior no doubt and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature but yet harriet more wonderful things have taken place there have been matches of greater disparity . but take care of yourself . i would not have you too sanguine though however it may end be assured your raising your thoughts to him is a mark of good taste which i shall always know how to value . harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude . emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend . its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation . chapter v in this state of schemes and hopes and connivance june opened upon hartfield . to highbury in general it brought no material change . the eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings and of the use to be made of their barouchelandau and jane fairfax was still at her grandmothers and as the return of the campbells from ireland was again delayed and august instead of midsummer fixed for it she was likely to remain there full two months longer provided at least she were able to defeat mrs .  eltons activity in her service and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will . mr .  knightley who for some reason best known to himself had certainly taken an early dislike to frank churchill was only growing to dislike him more . he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of emma . that emma was his object appeared indisputable . every thing declared it his own attentions his fathers hints his motherinlaws guarded silence it was all in unison words conduct discretion and indiscretion told the same story . but while so many were devoting him to emma and emma herself making him over to harriet mr .  knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax . he could not understand it but there were symptoms of intelligence between themhe thought so at least symptoms of admiration on his side which having once observed he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning however he might wish to escape any of emmas errors of imagination . she was not present when the suspicion first arose . he was dining with the randalls family and jane at the eltons and he had seen a look more than a single look at miss fairfax which from the admirer of miss woodhouse seemed somewhat out of place . when he was again in their company he could not help remembering what he had seen nor could he avoid observations which unless it were like cowper and his fire at twilight myself creating what i saw brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking of private understanding even between frank churchill and jane . he had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did to spend his evening at hartfield . emma and harriet were going to walk he joined them and on returning they fell in with a larger party who like themselves judged it wisest to take their exercise early as the weather threatened rain mr .  and mrs .  weston and their son miss bates and her niece who had accidentally met . they all united and on reaching hartfield gates emma who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him . the randalls party agreed to it immediately and after a pretty long speech from miss bates which few persons listened to she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouses most obliging invitation . as they were turning into the grounds mr .  perry passed by on horseback . the gentlemen spoke of his horse . by the bye said frank churchill to mrs .  weston presently what became of mr .  perrys plan of setting up his carriage mrs .  weston looked surprized and said i did not know that he ever had any such plan . nay i had it from you . you wrote me word of it three months ago . me impossible indeed you did . i remember it perfectly . you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon . mrs .  perry had told somebody and was extremely happy about it . it was owing to her persuasion as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm . you must remember it now upon my word i never heard of it till this moment . never really neverbless me how could it bethen i must have dreamt itbut i was completely persuadedmiss smith you walk as if you were tired . you will not be sorry to find yourself at home . what is thiswhat is this cried mr .  weston about perry and a carriage is perry going to set up his carriage frank i am glad he can afford it . you had it from himself had you no sir replied his son laughing i seem to have had it from nobody . very oddi really was persuaded of mrs .  westons having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago with all these particularsbut as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before of course it must have been a dream . i am a great dreamer . i dream of every body at highbury when i am away and when i have gone through my particular friends then i begin dreaming of mr .  and mrs .  perry . it is odd though observed his father that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe . perrys setting up his carriage and his wifes persuading him to it out of care for his health just what will happen i have no doubt some time or other only a little premature . what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream and at others what a heap of absurdities it is well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent . emma you are a great dreamer i think emma was out of hearing . she had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance and was beyond the reach of mr .  westons hint . why to own the truth cried miss bates who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes if i must speak on this subject there is no denying that mr .  frank churchill might havei do not mean to say that he did not dream iti am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the worldbut if i am questioned about it i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for mrs .  perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles knew of it as well as ourselvesbut it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days . mrs .  perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed . jane dont you remember grandmamas telling us of it when we got home i forget where we had been walking to very likely to randalls yes i think it was to randalls . mrs .  perry was always particularly fond of my motherindeed i do not know who is notand she had mentioned it to her in confidence she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go beyond and from that day to this i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of . at the same time i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware . i am a talker you know i am rather a talker and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not . i am not like jane i wish i were . i will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world . where is sheoh just behind . perfectly remember mrs .  perrys coming . extraordinary dream indeed they were entering the hall . mr .  knightleys eyes had preceded miss batess in a glance at jane . from frank churchills face where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away he had involuntarily turned to hers but she was indeed behind and too busy with her shawl . mr .  weston had walked in . the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass . mr .  knightley suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye he seemed watching her intentlyin vain however if it were so jane passed between them into the hall and looked at neither . there was no time for farther remark or explanation . the dream must be borne with and mr .  knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield and which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use instead of the smallsized pembroke on which two of his daily meals had for forty years been crowded . tea passed pleasantly and nobody seemed in a hurry to move . miss woodhouse said frank churchill after examining a table behind him which he could reach as he sat have your nephews taken away their alphabetstheir box of letters it used to stand here . where is it this is a sort of dulllooking evening that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer . we had great amusement with those letters one morning . i want to puzzle you again . emma was pleased with the thought and producing the box the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves . they were rapidly forming words for each other or for any body else who would be puzzled . the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for mr .  woodhouse who had often been distressed by the more animated sort which mr .  weston had occasionally introduced and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting with tender melancholy over the departure of the poor little boys or in fondly pointing out as he took up any stray letter near him how beautifully emma had written it . frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax . she gave a slight glance round the table and applied herself to it . frank was next to emma jane opposite to themand mr .  knightley so placed as to see them all and it was his object to see as much as he could with as little apparent observation . the word was discovered and with a faint smile pushed away . if meant to be immediately mixed with the others and buried from sight she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across for it was not mixed and harriet eager after every fresh word and finding out none directly took it up and fell to work . she was sitting by mr .  knightley and turned to him for help . the word was blunder and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it there was a blush on janes cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible . mr .  knightley connected it with the dream but how it could all be was beyond his comprehension . how the delicacy the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep he feared there must be some decided involvement . disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn . these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick . it was a childs play chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank churchills part . with great indignation did he continue to observe him with great alarm and distrust to observe also his two blinded companions . he saw a short word prepared for emma and given to her with a look sly and demure . he saw that emma had soon made it out and found it highly entertaining though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure for she said nonsense for shame he heard frank churchill next say with a glance towards jane i will give it to hershall iand as clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth . no no you must not you shall not indeed . it was done however . this gallant young man who seemed to love without feeling and to recommend himself without complaisance directly handed over the word to miss fairfax and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it . mr .  knightleys excessive curiosity to know what this word might be made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it and it was not long before he saw it to be dixon . jane fairfaxs perception seemed to accompany his her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning the superior intelligence of those five letters so arranged . she was evidently displeased looked up and seeing herself watched blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her and saying only i did not know that proper names were allowed pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered . her face was averted from those who had made the attack and turned towards her aunt . aye very true my dear cried the latter though jane had not spoken a wordi was just going to say the same thing . it is time for us to be going indeed . the evening is closing in and grandmama will be looking for us . my dear sir you are too obliging . we really must wish you good night . janes alertness in moving proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived . she was immediately up and wanting to quit the table but so many were also moving that she could not get away and mr .  knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her and resolutely swept away by her unexamined . she was afterwards looking for her shawlfrank churchill was looking alsoit was growing dusk and the room was in confusion and how they parted mr .  knightley could not tell . he remained at hartfield after all the rest his thoughts full of what he had seen so full that when the candles came to assist his observations he mustyes he certainly must as a friend an anxious friendgive emma some hint ask her some question . he could not see her in a situation of such danger without trying to preserve her . it was his duty . pray emma said he may i ask in what lay the great amusement the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax i saw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other . emma was extremely confused . she could not endure to give him the true explanation for though her suspicions were by no means removed she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them . oh she cried in evident embarrassment it all meant nothing a mere joke among ourselves . the joke he replied gravely seemed confined to you and mr .  churchill . he had hoped she would speak again but she did not . she would rather busy herself about any thing than speak . he sat a little while in doubt . a variety of evils crossed his mind . interference fruitless interference . emmas confusion and the acknowledged intimacy seemed to declare her affection engaged . yet he would speak . he owed it to her to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference rather than her welfare to encounter any thing rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause . my dear emma said he at last with earnest kindness do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of between mr .  frank churchill and miss fairfax oh yes perfectly . why do you make a doubt of it have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her or that she admired him never never she cried with a most open eagernessnever for the twentieth part of a moment did such an idea occur to me . and how could it possibly come into your head i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them certain expressive looks which i did not believe meant to be public . oh you amuse me excessively . i am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wanderbut it will not do very sorry to check you in your first essaybut indeed it will not do . there is no admiration between them i do assure you and the appearances which have caught you have arisen from some peculiar circumstancesfeelings rather of a totally different nature it is impossible exactly to explainthere is a good deal of nonsense in itbut the part which is capable of being communicated which is sense is that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another as any two beings in the world can be . that is i presume it to be so on her side and i can answer for its being so on his . i will answer for the gentlemans indifference . she spoke with a confidence which staggered with a satisfaction which silenced mr .  knightley . she was in gay spirits and would have prolonged the conversation wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions every look described and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her but his gaiety did not meet hers . he found he could not be useful and his feelings were too much irritated for talking . that he might not be irritated into an absolute fever by the fire which mr .  woodhouses tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year he soon afterwards took a hasty leave and walked home to the coolness and solitude of donwell abbey . chapter vi after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr .  and mrs .  suckling the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn . no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present . in the daily interchange of news they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings coming had been united such as the last accounts of mrs .  churchill whose health seemed every day to supply a different report and the situation of mrs .  weston whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it . mrs .  elton was very much disappointed . it was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade . her introductions and recommendations must all wait and every projected party be still only talked of . so she thought at firstbut a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off . why should not they explore to box hill though the sucklings did not come they could go there again with them in the autumn . it was settled that they should go to box hill . that there was to be such a party had been long generally known it had even given the idea of another . emma had never been to box hill she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing and she and mr .  weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither . two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them and it was to be done in a quiet unpretending elegant way infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation the regular eating and drinking and picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings . this was so very well understood between them that emma could not but feel some surprise and a little displeasure on hearing from mr .  weston that he had been proposing to mrs .  elton as her brother and sister had failed her that the two parties should unite and go together and that as mrs .  elton had very readily acceded to it so it was to be if she had no objection . now as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs .  elton of which mr .  weston must already be perfectly aware it was not worth bringing forward againit could not be done without a reproof to him which would be giving pain to his wife and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of mrs .  eltons party every feeling was offended and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr .  westons temper . i am glad you approve of what i have done said he very comfortably . but i thought you would . such schemes as these are nothing without numbers . one cannot have too large a party . a large party secures its own amusement . and she is a goodnatured woman after all . one could not leave her out . emma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private . it was now the middle of june and the weather fine and mrs .  elton was growing impatient to name the day and settle with mr .  weston as to pigeonpies and cold lamb when a lame carriagehorse threw every thing into sad uncertainty . it might be weeks it might be only a few days before the horse were useable but no preparations could be ventured on and it was all melancholy stagnation . mrs .  eltons resources were inadequate to such an attack . is not this most vexations knightley she cried . and such weather for exploringthese delays and disappointments are quite odious . what are we to dothe year will wear away at this rate and nothing done . before this time last year i assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from maple grove to kings weston . you had better explore to donwell replied mr .  knightley . that may be done without horses . come and eat my strawberries . they are ripening fast . if mr .  knightley did not begin seriously he was obliged to proceed so for his proposal was caught at with delight and the oh i should like it of all things was not plainer in words than manner . donwell was famous for its strawberrybeds which seemed a plea for the invitation but no plea was necessary cabbagebeds would have been enough to tempt the lady who only wanted to be going somewhere . she promised him again and again to comemuch oftener than he doubtedand was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it . you may depend upon me said she . i certainly will come . name your day and i will come . you will allow me to bring jane fairfax i cannot name a day said he till i have spoken to some others whom i would wish to meet you . oh leave all that to me . only give me a carteblanche . i am lady patroness you know . it is my party . i will bring friends with me . i hope you will bring elton said he but i will not trouble you to give any other invitations . oh now you are looking very sly . but consideryou need not be afraid of delegating power to me . i am no young lady on her preferment . married women you know may be safely authorised . it is my party . leave it all to me . i will invite your guests . nohe calmly repliedthere is but one married woman in the world whom i can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell and that one is mrs .  weston i suppose interrupted mrs .  elton rather mortified . nomrs . knightleyand till she is in being i will manage such matters myself . ah you are an odd creature she cried satisfied to have no one preferred to herself . you are a humourist and may say what you like . quite a humourist . well i shall bring jane with me jane and her aunt . the rest i leave to you . i have no objections at all to meeting the hartfield family . dont scruple . i know you are attached to them . you certainly will meet them if i can prevail and i shall call on miss bates in my way home . thats quite unnecessary i see jane every daybut as you like . it is to be a morning scheme you know knightley quite a simple thing . i shall wear a large bonnet and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm . hereprobably this basket with pink ribbon . nothing can be more simple you see . and jane will have such another . there is to be no form or paradea sort of gipsy party . we are to walk about your gardens and gather the strawberries ourselves and sit under treesand whatever else you may like to provide it is to be all out of doorsa table spread in the shade you know . every thing as natural and simple as possible . is not that your idea not quite . my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the diningroom . the nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies with their servants and furniture i think is best observed by meals within doors . when you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden there shall be cold meat in the house . wellas you please only dont have a great set out . and by the bye can i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion pray be sincere knightley . if you wish me to talk to mrs .  hodges or to inspect anything i have not the least wish for it i thank you . wellbut if any difficulties should arise my housekeeper is extremely clever . i will answer for it that mine thinks herself full as clever and would spurn any bodys assistance . i wish we had a donkey . the thing would be for us all to come on donkeys jane miss bates and meand my caro sposo walking by . i really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey . in a country life i conceive it to be a sort of necessary for let a woman have ever so many resources it is not possible for her to be always shut up at homeand very long walks you knowin summer there is dust and in winter there is dirt . you will not find either between donwell and highbury . donwell lane is never dusty and now it is perfectly dry . come on a donkey however if you prefer it . you can borrow mrs .  coles . i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible . that i am sure you would . indeed i do you justice my good friend . under that peculiar sort of dry blunt manner i know you have the warmest heart . as i tell mr .  e .  you are a thorough humourist . yes believe me knightley i am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme . you have hit upon the very thing to please me . mr .  knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade . he wished to persuade mr .  woodhouse as well as emma to join the party and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill .  mr .  woodhouse must not under the specious pretence of a morning drive and an hour or two spent at donwell be tempted away to his misery . he was invited on good faith . no lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity . he did consent . he had not been at donwell for two years . some very fine morning he and emma and harriet could go very well and he could sit still with mrs .  weston while the dear girls walked about the gardens . he did not suppose they could be damp now in the middle of the day . he should like to see the old house again exceedingly and should be very happy to meet mr .  and mrs .  elton and any other of his neighbours . he could not see any objection at all to his and emmas and harriets going there some very fine morning . he thought it very well done of mr .  knightley to invite them very kind and sensiblemuch cleverer than dining out . he was not fond of dining out . mr .  knightley was fortunate in every bodys most ready concurrence . the invitation was everywhere so well received that it seemed as if like mrs .  elton they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves . emma and harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it and mr .  weston unasked promised to get frank over to join them if possible a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with . mr .  knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him and mr .  weston engaged to lose no time in writing and spare no arguments to induce him to come . in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast that the party to box hill was again under happy consideration and at last donwell was settled for one day and box hill for the nextthe weather appearing exactly right . under a bright midday sun at almost midsummer mr .  woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage with one window down to partake of this alfresco party and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the abbey especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning he was happily placed quite at his ease ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved and advise every body to come and sit down and not to heat themselves . mrs .  weston who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired and sit all the time with him remained when all the others were invited or persuaded out his patient listener and sympathiser . it was so long since emma had been at the abbey that as soon as she was satisfied of her fathers comfort she was glad to leave him and look around her eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family . she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building its suitable becoming characteristic situation low and sheltered its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream of which the abbey with all the old neglect of prospect had scarcely a sightand its abundance of timber in rows and avenues which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up . the house was larger than hartfield and totally unlike it covering a good deal of ground rambling and irregular with many comfortable and one or two handsome rooms . it was just what it ought to be and it looked what it wasand emma felt an increasing respect for it as the residence of a family of such true gentility untainted in blood and understanding . some faults of temper john knightley had but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably . she had given them neither men nor names nor places that could raise a blush . these were pleasant feelings and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did and collect round the strawberrybeds . the whole party were assembled excepting frank churchill who was expected every moment from richmond and mrs .  elton in all her apparatus of happiness her large bonnet and her basket was very ready to lead the way in gathering accepting or talkingstrawberries and only strawberries could now be thought or spoken of . the best fruit in england every bodys favouritealways wholesome . these the finest beds and finest sorts . delightful to

rule gardeners never to be put out of their waydelicious fruit only too rich to be eaten much ofinferior to cherries currants more refreshingonly objection to gathering strawberries the stoopingglaring suntired to deathcould bear it no longer must go and sit in the shade . such for half an hour was the conversationinterrupted only once by mrs .  weston who came out in her solicitude after her soninlaw to inquire if he were comeand she was a little uneasy . she had some fears of his horse . seats tolerably in the shade were found and now emma was obliged to overhear what mrs .  elton and jane fairfax were talking of . a situation a most desirable situation was in question . mrs .  elton had received notice of it that morning and was in raptures . it was not with mrs .  suckling it was not with mrs .  bragge but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them it was with a cousin of mrs .  bragge an acquaintance of mrs .  suckling a lady known at maple grove . delightful charming superior first circles spheres lines ranks every thingand mrs .  elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately . on her side all was warmth energy and triumphand she positively refused to take her friends negative though miss fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before . still mrs .  elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrows post . how jane could bear it at all was astonishing to emma . she did look vexed she did speak pointedlyand at last with a decision of action unusual to her proposed a removal . should not they walk would not mr .  knightley shew them the gardens all the gardensshe wished to see the whole extent . the pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear . it was hot and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered dispersed way scarcely any three together they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds . it led to nothing nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars which seemed intended in their erection to give the appearance of an approach to the house which never had been there . disputable however as might be the taste of such a termination it was in itself a charming walk and the view which closed it extremely pretty . the considerable slope at nearly the foot of which the abbey stood gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur well clothed with wood and at the bottom of this bank favourably placed and sheltered rose the abbey mill farm with meadows in front and the river making a close and handsome curve around it . it was a sweet viewsweet to the eye and the mind . english verdure english culture english comfort seen under a sun bright without being oppressive . in this walk emma and mr .  weston found all the others assembled and towards this view she immediately perceived mr .  knightley and harriet distinct from the rest quietly leading the way . mr .  knightley and harrietit was an odd teteatete but she was glad to see it . there had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion and turned from her with little ceremony . now they seemed in pleasant conversation . there had been a time also when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot so favourable for the abbey mill farm but now she feared it not . it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty its rich pastures spreading flocks orchard in blossom and light column of smoke ascending . she joined them at the wall and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around . he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture etc . and emma received a smile which seemed to say these are my own concerns . i have a right to talk on such subjects without being suspected of introducing robert martin . she did not suspect him . it was too old a story . robert martin had probably ceased to think of harriet . they took a few turns together along the walk . the shade was most refreshing and emma found it the pleasantest part of the day . the next remove was to the house they must all go in and eat and they were all seated and busy and still frank churchill did not come . mrs .  weston looked and looked in vain . his father would not own himself uneasy and laughed at her fears but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare . he had expressed himself as to coming with more than common certainty . his aunt was so much better that he had not a doubt of getting over to them . mrs . churchills state however as many were ready to remind her was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependenceand mrs .  weston was at last persuaded to believe or to say that it must be by some attack of mrs .  churchill that he was prevented coming . emma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration she behaved very well and betrayed no emotion . the cold repast was over and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen the old abbey fishponds perhaps get as far as the clover which was to be begun cutting on the morrow or at any rate have the pleasure of being hot and growing cool again . mr . woodhouse who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens where no damps from the river were imagined even by him stirred no more and his daughter resolved to remain with him that mrs .  weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need . mr .  knightley had done all in his power for mr .  woodhouses entertainment . books of engravings drawers of medals cameos corals shells and every other family collection within his cabinets had been prepared for his old friend to while away the morning and the kindness had perfectly answered . mr .  woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused . mrs .  weston had been shewing them all to him and now he would shew them all to emmafortunate in having no other resemblance to a child than in a total want of taste for what he saw for he was slow constant and methodical . before this second looking over was begun however emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments free observation of the entrance and groundplot of the houseand was hardly there when jane fairfax appeared coming quickly in from the garden and with a look of escape . little expecting to meet miss woodhouse so soon there was a start at first but miss woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of . will you be so kind said she when i am missed as to say that i am gone homei am going this moment . my aunt is not aware how late it is nor how long we have been absentbut i am sure we shall be wanted and i am determined to go directly . i have said nothing about it to any body . it would only be giving trouble and distress . some are gone to the ponds and some to the lime walk . till they all come in i shall not be missed and when they do will you have the goodness to say that i am gone certainly if you wish itbut you are not going to walk to highbury alone yeswhat should hurt mei walk fast . i shall be at home in twenty minutes . but it is too far indeed it is to be walking quite alone . let my fathers servant go with you . let me order the carriage . it can be round in five minutes . thank you thank youbut on no account . i would rather walk . and for me to be afraid of walking alonei who may so soon have to guard others she spoke with great agitation and emma very feelingly replied that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now . i must order the carriage . the heat even would be danger . you are fatigued already . i amshe answeredi am fatigued but it is not the sort of fatiguequick walking will refresh me . miss woodhouse we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits . mine i confess are exhausted . the greatest kindness you can shew me will be to let me have my own way and only say that i am gone when it is necessary . emma had not another word to oppose . she saw it all and entering into her feelings promoted her quitting the house immediately and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend . her parting look was gratefuland her parting words oh miss woodhouse the comfort of being sometimes aloneseemed to burst from an overcharged heart and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her even towards some of those who loved her best . such a home indeed such an aunt said emma as she turned back into the hall again . i do pity you . and the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors the more i shall like you . jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour and they had only accomplished some views of st .  marks place venice when frank churchill entered the room . emma had not been thinking of him she had forgotten to think of himbut she was very glad to see him . mrs .  weston would be at ease . the black mare was blameless they were right who had named mrs .  churchill as the cause . he had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her a nervous seizure which had lasted some hoursand he had quite given up every thought of coming till very lateand had he known how hot a ride he should have and how late with all his hurry he must be he believed he should not have come at all . the heat was excessive he had never suffered any thing like italmost wished he had staid at homenothing killed him like heathe could bear any degree of cold etc . but heat was intolerableand he sat down at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of mr .  woodhouses fire looking very deplorable . you will soon be cooler if you sit still said emma . as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again . i could very ill be sparedbut such a point had been made of my coming you will all be going soon i suppose the whole party breaking up . i met one as i camemadness in such weatherabsolute madness emma listened and looked and soon perceived that frank churchills state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour . some people were always cross when they were hot . such might be his constitution and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints she recommended his taking some refreshment he would find abundance of every thing in the diningroomand she humanely pointed out the door . nohe should not eat . he was not hungry it would only make him hotter . in two minutes however he relented in his own favour and muttering something about sprucebeer walked off . emma returned all her attention to her father saying in secret i am glad i have done being in love with him . i should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning . harriets sweet easy temper will not mind it . he was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal and came back all the bettergrown quite cooland with good manners like himselfable to draw a chair close to them take an interest in their employment and regret in a reasonable way that he should be so late . he was not in his best spirits but seemed trying to improve them and at last made himself talk nonsense very agreeably . they were looking over views in swisserland . as soon as my aunt gets well i shall go abroad said he . i shall never be easy till i have seen some of these places . you will have my sketches some time or other to look ator my tour to reador my poem . i shall do something to expose myself . that may bebut not by sketches in swisserland . you will never go to swisserland . your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave england . they may be induced to go too . a warm climate may be prescribed for her . i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad . i assure you i have . i feel a strong persuasion this morning that i shall soon be abroad . i ought to travel . i am tired of doing nothing . i want a change . i am serious miss woodhouse whatever your penetrating eyes may fancyi am sick of england and would leave it tomorrow if i could . you are sick of prosperity and indulgence . cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself and be contented to stay i sick of prosperity and indulgence you are quite mistaken . i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged . i am thwarted in every thing material . i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person . you are not quite so miserable though as when you first came . go and eat and drink a little more and you will do very well . another slice of cold meat another draught of madeira and water will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us . noi shall not stir . i shall sit by you . you are my best cure . we are going to box hill tomorrowyou will join us . it is not swisserland but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change . you will stay and go with us no certainly not i shall go home in the cool of the evening . but you may come again in the cool of tomorrow morning . noit will not be worth while . if i come i shall be cross . then pray stay at richmond . but if i do i shall be crosser still . i can never bear to think of you all there without me . these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself . chuse your own degree of crossness . i shall press you no more . the rest of the party were now returning and all were soon collected . with some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill others took it very composedly but there was a very general distress and disturbance on miss fairfaxs disappearance being explained . that it was time for every body to go concluded the subject and with a short final arrangement for the next days scheme they parted . frank churchills little inclination to exclude himself increased so much that his last words to emma were wellif you wish me to stay and join the party i will . she smiled her acceptance and nothing less than a summons from richmond was to take him back before the following evening . chapter vii they had a very fine day for box hill and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement accommodation and punctuality were in favour of a pleasant party . mr .  weston directed the whole officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage and every body was in good time . emma and harriet went together miss bates and her niece with the eltons the gentlemen on horseback . mrs .  weston remained with mr .  woodhouse . nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there . seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency . there was a languor a want of spirits a want of union which could not be got over . they separated too much into parties . the eltons walked together mr .  knightley took charge of miss bates and jane and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill . and mr .  weston tried in vain to make them harmonise better . it seemed at first an accidental division but it never materially varied . mr .  and mrs .  elton indeed shewed no unwillingness to mix and be as agreeable as they could but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill there seemed a principle of separation between the other parties too strong for any fine prospects or any cold collation or any cheerful mr .  weston to remove . at first it was downright dulness to emma . she had never seen frank churchill so silent and stupid . he said nothing worth hearing looked without seeingadmired without intelligencelistened without knowing what she said . while he was so dull it was no wonder that harriet should be dull likewise and they were both insufferable . when they all sat down it was better to her taste a great deal better for frank churchill grew talkative and gay making her his first object . every distinguishing attention that could be paid was paid to her . to amuse her and be agreeable in her eyes seemed all that he cared forand emma glad to be enlivened not sorry to be flattered was gay and easy too and gave him all the friendly encouragement the admission to be gallant which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance but which now in her own estimation meant nothing though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english word but flirtation could very well describe . mr .  frank churchill and miss woodhouse flirted together excessively . they were laying themselves open to that very phraseand to having it sent off in a letter to maple grove by one lady to ireland by another . not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected . she laughed because she was disappointed and though she liked him for his attentions and thought them all whether in friendship admiration or playfulness extremely judicious they were not winning back her heart . she still intended him for her friend . how much i am obliged to you said he for telling me to come today if it had not been for you i should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party . i had quite determined to go away again . yes you were very cross and i do not know what about except that you were too late for the best strawberries . i was a kinder friend than you deserved . but you were humble . you begged hard to be commanded to come . dont say i was cross . i was fatigued . the heat overcame me . it is hotter today . not to my feelings . i am perfectly comfortable today . you are comfortable because you are under command . your commandyes . perhaps i intended you to say so but i meant selfcommand . you had somehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your own management but today you are got back againand as i cannot be always with you it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine . it comes to the same thing . i can have no selfcommand without a motive . you order me whether you speak or not . and you can be always with me . you are always with me . dating from three oclock yesterday . my perpetual influence could not begin earlier or you would not have been so much out of humour before . three oclock yesterday that is your date . i thought i had seen you first in february . your gallantry is really unanswerable . but lowering her voice nobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people . i say nothing of which i am ashamed replied he with lively impudence . i saw you first in february . let every body on the hill hear me if they can . let my accents swell to mickleham on one side and dorking on the other . i saw you first in february . and then whispering our companions are excessively stupid . what shall we do to rouse them any nonsense will serve . they shall talk . ladies and gentlemen i am ordered by miss woodhouse who wherever she is presides to say that she desires to know what you are all thinking of some laughed and answered goodhumouredly . miss bates said a great deal mrs .  elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouses presiding mr .  knightleys answer was the most distinct . is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of oh no nocried emma laughing as carelessly as she could upon no account in the world . it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now . let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of . i will not say quite all . there are one or two perhaps glancing at mr .  weston and harriet whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing . it is a sort of thing cried mrs .  elton emphatically which i should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into . though perhaps as the chaperon of the party i never was in any circleexploring partiesyoung ladiesmarried women her mutterings were chiefly to her husband and he murmured in reply very true my love very true . exactly so indeedquite unheard of but some ladies say any thing . better pass it off as a joke . every body knows what is due to you . it will not do whispered frank to emma they are most of them affronted . i will attack them with more address . ladies and gentlemeni am ordered by miss woodhouse to say that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of and only requires something very entertaining from each of you in a general way . here are seven of you besides myself who she is pleased to say am very entertaining already and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever be it prose or verse original or repeatedor two things moderately clever or three things very dull indeed and she engages to laugh heartily at them all . oh very well exclaimed miss bates then i need not be uneasy . three things very dull indeed . that will just do for me you know . i shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open my mouth shant i looking round with the most goodhumoured dependence on every bodys assentdo not you all think i shall emma could not resist . ah maam but there may be a difficulty . pardon mebut you will be limited as to numberonly three at once . miss bates deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner did not immediately catch her meaning but when it burst on her it could not anger though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her . ahwellto be sure . yes i see what she means turning to mr .  knightley and i will try to hold my tongue . i must make myself very disagreeable or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend . i like your plan cried mr .  weston . agreed agreed . i will do my best . i am making a conundrum . how will a conundrum reckon low i am afraid sir very low answered his sonbut we shall be indulgentespecially to any one who leads the way . no no said emma it will not reckon low . a conundrum of mr .  westons shall clear him and his next neighbour . come sir pray let me hear it . i doubt its being very clever myself said mr .  weston . it is too much a matter of fact but here it is . what two letters of the alphabet are there that express perfection what two lettersexpress perfection i am sure i do not know . ah you will never guess . you to emma i am certain will never guess . i will tell you . m . and a . emma . do you understand understanding and gratification came together . it might be a very indifferent piece of wit but emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in itand so did frank and harriet . it did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally some looked very stupid about it and mr .  knightley gravely said this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and mr .  weston has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every body else . perfection should not have come quite so soon . oh for myself i protest i must be excused said mrs .  elton i really cannot attempti am not at all fond of the sort of thing . i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name which i was not at all pleased with . i knew who it came from . an abominable puppy you know who i mean nodding to her husband . these kind of things are very well at christmas when one is sitting round the fire but quite out of place in my opinion when one is exploring about the country in summer . miss woodhouse must excuse me . i am not one of those who have witty things at every bodys service . i do not pretend to be a wit . i have a great deal of vivacity in my own way but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue . pass us if you please mr .  churchill . pass mr .  e .  knightley jane and myself . we have nothing clever to say not one of us . yes yes pray pass me added her husband with a sort of sneering consciousness i have nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse or any other young lady . an old married man quite good for nothing . shall we walk augusta with all my heart . i am really tired of exploring so long on one spot . come jane take my other arm . jane declined it however and the husband and wife walked off . happy couple said frank churchill as soon as they were out of hearinghow well they suit one anothervery luckymarrying as they did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public placethey only knew each other i think a few weeks in bath peculiarly lucky for as to any real knowledge of a persons disposition that bath or any public place can giveit is all nothing there can be no knowledge . it is only by seeing women in their own homes among their own set just as they always are that you can form any just judgment . short of that it is all guess and luck and will generally be illluck . how many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance and rued it all the rest of his life miss fairfax who had seldom spoken before except among her own confederates spoke now . such things do occur undoubtedly . she was stopped by a cough . frank churchill turned towards her to listen . you were speaking said he gravely . she recovered her voice . i was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them to be very frequent . a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards . i would be understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience an oppression for ever . he made no answer merely looked and bowed in submission and soon afterwards said in a lively tone well i have so little confidence in my own judgment that whenever i marry i hope some body will chuse my wife for me . will you turning to emma . will you chuse a wife for mei am sure i should like any body fixed on by you . you provide for the family you know with a smile at his father . find some body for me . i am in no hurry . adopt her educate her . and make her like myself . by all means if you can . very well . i undertake the commission . you shall have a charming wife . she must be very lively and have hazle eyes . i care for nothing else . i shall go abroad for a couple of yearsand when i return i shall come to you for my wife . remember . emma was in no danger of forgetting . it was a commission to touch every favourite feeling . would not harriet be the very creature described hazle eyes excepted two years more might make her all that he wished . he might even have harriet in his thoughts at the moment who could say referring the education to her seemed to imply it . now maam said jane to her aunt shall we join mrs .  elton if you please my dear . with all my heart . i am quite ready . i was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well . we shall soon overtake her . there she isno thats somebody else . thats one of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like her . well i declare they walked off followed in half a minute by mr .  knightley . mr .  weston his son emma and harriet only remained and the young mans spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant . even emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others or sitting almost alone and quite unattended to in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her . the appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart and the solicitude of mrs .  elton to have her carriage first were gladly endured in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure . such another scheme composed of so many illassorted people she hoped never to be betrayed into again . while waiting for the carriage she found mr .  knightley by her side . he looked around as if to see that no one were near and then said emma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do a privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but i must still use it . i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance . how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates how could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situation emma i had not thought it possible . emma recollected blushed was sorry but tried to laugh it off . nay how could i help saying what i didnobody could have helped it . it was not so very bad . i dare say she did not understand me . i assure you she did . she felt your full meaning . she has talked of it since . i wish you could have heard how she talked of it with what candour and generosity . i wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be so irksome . oh cried emma i know there is not a better creature in the world but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her . they are blended said he i acknowledge and were she prosperous i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good . were she a woman of fortune i would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance i would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner . were she your equal in situation but emma consider how far this is from being the case . she is poor she has sunk from the comforts she was born to and if she live to old age must probably sink more . her situation should secure your compassion . it was badly done indeed you whom she had known from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble herand before her niece tooand before others many of whom certainly some would be entirely guided by your treatment of her . this is not pleasant to you emmaand it is very far from pleasant to me but i must i willi will tell you truths while i can satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now . while they talked they were advancing towards the carriage it was ready and before she could speak again he had handed her in . he had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted and her tongue motionless . they were combined only of anger against herself mortification and deep concern . she had not been able to speak and on entering the carriage sunk back for a moment overcomethen reproaching herself for having taken no leave making no acknowledgment parting in apparent sullenness she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference but it was just too late . he had turned away and the horses were in motion . she continued to look back but in vain and soon with what appeared unusual speed they were half way down the hill and every thing left far behind . she was vexed beyond what could have been expressedalmost beyond what she could conceal . never had she felt so agitated mortified grieved at any circumstance in her life . she was most forcibly struck . the truth of this representation there was no denying . she felt it at her heart . how could she have been so brutal so cruel to miss bates how could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued and how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude of concurrence of common kindness time did not compose her . as she reflected more she seemed but to feel it more . she never had been so depressed . happily it was not necessary to speak . there was only harriet who seemed not in spirits herself fagged and very willing to be silent and emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home without being at any trouble to check them extraordinary as they were . chapter viii the wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emmas thoughts all the evening . how it might be considered by the rest of the party she could not tell . they in their different homes and their different ways might be looking back on it with pleasure but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time and more to be abhorred in recollection than any she had ever passed . a whole evening of backgammon with her father was felicity to it . there indeed lay real pleasure for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twentyfour to his comfort and feeling that unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem she could not in her general conduct be open to any severe reproach . as a daughter she hoped she was not without a heart . she hoped no one could have said to her how could you be so unfeeling to your father i must i will tell you truths while i can . miss bates should never againno never if attention in future could do away the past she might hope to be forgiven . she had been often remiss her conscience told her so remiss perhaps more in thought than fact scornful ungracious . but it should be so no more . in the warmth of true contrition she would call upon her the very next morning and it should be the beginning on her side of a regular equal kindly intercourse . she was just as determined when the morrow came and went early that nothing might prevent her . it was not unlikely she thought that she might see mr .  knightley in her way or perhaps he might come in while she were paying her visit . she had no objection . she would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence so justly and truly hers . her eyes were towards donwell as she walked but she saw him not . the ladies were all at home . she had never rejoiced at the sound before nor ever before entered the passage nor walked up the stairs with any wish of giving pleasure but in conferring obligation or of deriving it except in subsequent ridicule . there was a bustle on her approach a good deal of moving and talking . she heard miss batess voice something was to be done in a hurry the maid looked frightened and awkward hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment and then ushered her in too soon . the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room . jane she had a distinct glimpse of looking extremely ill and before the door had shut them out she heard miss bates saying well my dear i shall say you are laid down upon the bed and i am sure you are ill enough . poor old mrs .  bates civil and humble as usual looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on . i am afraid jane is not very well said she but i do not know they tell me she is well . i dare say my daughter will be here presently miss woodhouse . i hope you find a chair . i wish hetty had not gone . i am very little ablehave you a chair maam do you sit where you like i am sure she will be here presently . emma seriously hoped she would . she had a moments fear of miss bates keeping away from her . but miss bates soon camevery happy and obligedbut emmas conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as beforeless ease of look and manner . a very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax she hoped might lead the way to a return of old feelings . the touch seemed immediate . ah miss woodhouse how kind you arei suppose you have heard and are come to give us joy . this does not seem much like joy indeed in metwinkling away a tear or twobut it will be very trying for us to part with her after having had her so long and she has a dreadful headache just now writing all the morning such long letters you know to be written to colonel campbell and mrs .  dixon . my dear said i you will blind yourself for tears were in her eyes perpetually . one cannot wonder one cannot wonder . it is a great change and though she is amazingly fortunatesuch a situation i suppose as no young woman before ever met with on first going outdo not think us ungrateful miss woodhouse for such surprising good fortuneagain dispersing her tearsbut poor dear soul if you were to see what a headache she has . when one is in great pain you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve . she is as low as possible . to look at her nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation . you will excuse her not coming to youshe is not ableshe is gone into her own room i want her to lie down upon the bed . my dear said i i shall say you are laid down upon the bed but however she is not she is walking about the room . but now that she has written her letters she says she shall soon be well . she will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you miss woodhouse but your kindness will excuse her . you were kept waiting at the doori was quite ashamed but somehow there was a little bustlefor it so happened that we had not heard the knock and till you were on the stairs we did not know any body was coming . it is only mrs .  cole said i depend upon it . nobody else would come so early . well said she it must be borne some time or other and it may as well be now . but then patty came in and said it was you . oh said i it is miss woodhouse i am sure you will like to see her . i can see nobody said she and up she got and would go away and that was what made us keep you waitingand extremely sorry and ashamed we were . if you must go my dear said i you must and i will say you are laid down upon the bed . emma was most sincerely interested . her heart had been long growing kinder towards jane and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion and left her nothing but pity and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past obliged her to admit that jane might very naturally resolve on seeing mrs .  cole or any other steady friend when she might not bear to see herself . she spoke as she felt with earnest regret and solicitudesincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually determined on might be as much for miss fairfaxs advantage and comfort as possible . it must be a severe trial to them all . she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbells return . so very kind replied miss bates . but you are always kind . there was no bearing such an always and to break through her dreadful gratitude emma made the direct inquiry of wheremay i askis miss fairfax going to a mrs .  smallridgecharming womanmost superiorto have the charge of her three little girlsdelightful children . impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort if we except perhaps mrs .  sucklings own family and mrs .  bragges but mrs .  smallridge is intimate with both and in the very same neighbourhoodlives only four miles from maple grove . jane will be only four miles from maple grove . mrs .  elton i suppose has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes yes our good mrs .  elton . the most indefatigable true friend . she would not take a denial . she would not let jane say no for when jane first heard of it it was the day before yesterday the very morning we were at donwell when jane first heard of it she was quite decided against accepting the offer and for the reasons you mention exactly as you say she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbells return and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at presentand so she told mrs .  elton over and over againand i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mindbut that good mrs .  elton whose judgment never fails her saw farther than i did . it is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did and refuse to take janes answer but she positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday as jane wished her she would waitand sure enough yesterday evening it was all settled that jane should go . quite a surprize to me i had not the least ideajane took mrs .  elton aside and told her at once that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs .  smallridges situation she had come to the resolution of accepting it . i did not know a word of it till it was all settled . you spent the evening with mrs .  elton yes all of us mrs .  elton would have us come . it was settled so upon the hill while we were walking about with mr .  knightley . you must all spend your evening with us said shei positively must have you all come . mr .  knightley was there too was he no not mr .  knightley he declined it from the first and though i thought he would come because mrs .  elton declared she would not let him off he did notbut my mother and jane and i were all there and a very agreeable evening we had . such kind friends you know miss woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body seemed rather fagged after the mornings party . even pleasure you know is fatiguingand i cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it . however i shall always think it a very pleasant party and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it . miss fairfax i suppose though you were not aware of it had been making up her mind the whole day i dare say she had . whenever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all her friendsbut i hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possiblei mean as to the character and manners of the family . thank you dear miss woodhouse . yes indeed there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it . except the sucklings and bragges there is not such another nursery establishment so liberal and elegant in all mrs .  eltons acquaintance . mrs .  smallridge a most delightful womana style of living almost equal to maple groveand as to the children except the little sucklings and little bragges there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere . jane will be treated with such regard and kindness it will be nothing but pleasure a life of pleasure . and her salary i really cannot venture to name her salary to you miss woodhouse . even you used as you are to great sums would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like jane . ah madam cried emma if other children are at all like what i remember to have been myself i should think five times the amount of what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions dearly earned . you are so noble in your ideas and when is miss fairfax to leave you very soon very soon indeed thats the worst of it . within a fortnight . mrs .  smallridge is in a great hurry . my poor mother does not know how to bear it . so then i try to put it out of her thoughts and say come maam do not let us think about it any more . her friends must all be sorry to lose her and will not colonel and mrs .  campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return yes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining . i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs .  elton and when mrs .  elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it it was before teastayno it could not be before tea because we were just going to cardsand yet it was before tea because i remember thinkingoh no now i recollect now i have it something happened before tea but not that . mr .  elton was called out of the room before tea old john abdys son wanted to speak with him . poor old john i have a great regard for him he was clerk to my poor father twentyseven years and now poor old man he is bedridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints i must go and see him today and so will jane i am sure if she gets out at all . and poor johns son came to talk to mr .  elton about relief from the parish he is very well to do himself you know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help and so when mr .  elton came back he told us what john ostler had been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr .  frank churchill to richmond . that was what happened before tea . it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs .  elton . miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of mr .  frank churchills going she proceeded to give them all it was of no consequence . what mr .  elton had learned from the ostler on the subject being the accumulation of the ostlers own knowledge and the knowledge of the servants at randalls was that a messenger had come over from richmond soon after the return of the party from box hill which messenger however had been no more than was expected and that mr .  churchill had sent his nephew a few lines containing upon the whole a tolerable account of mrs .  churchill and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early but that mr .  frank churchill having resolved to go home directly without waiting at all and his horse seeming to have got a cold tom had been sent off immediately for the crown chaise and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by the boy going a good pace and driving very steady . there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest and it caught emmas attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind . the contrast between mrs .  churchills importance in the world and jane fairfaxs struck her one was every thing the other nothingand she sat musing on the difference of womans destiny and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed till roused by miss batess saying aye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte . what is to become of thatvery true . poor dear jane was talking of it just now . you must go said she . you and i must part . you will have no business here . let it stay however said she give it houseroom till colonel campbell comes back . i shall talk about it to him he will settle for me he will help me out of all my difficulties . and to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughters . now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough and with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt took leave . chapter ix emmas pensive meditations as she walked home were not interrupted but on entering the parlour she found those who must rouse her . mr .  knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence and were sitting with her father . mr . knightley immediately got up and in a manner decidedly graver than usual said i would not go away without seeing you but i have no time to spare and therefore must now be gone directly . i am going to london to spend a few days with john and isabella . have you any thing to send or say besides the love which nobody carries nothing at all . but is not this a sudden scheme yesratheri have been thinking of it some little time . emma was sure he had not forgiven her he looked unlike himself . time however she thought would tell him that they ought to be friends again . while he stood as if meaning to go but not going her father began his inquiries . well my dear and did you get there safelyand how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughteri dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming . dear emma has been to call on mrs .  and miss bates mr .  knightley as i told you before . she is always so attentive to them emmas colour was heightened by this unjust praise and with a smile and shake of the head which spoke much she looked at mr .  knightley . it seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour as if his eyes received the truth from hers and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured . he looked at her with a glow of regard . she was warmly gratified and in another moment still more so by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part . he took her hand whether she had not herself made the first motion she could not say she might perhaps have rather offered itbut he took her hand pressed it and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips when from some fancy or other he suddenly let it go . why he should feel such a scruple why he should change his mind when it was all but done she could not perceive . he would have judged better she thought if he had not stopped . the intention however was indubitable and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry or however else it happened but she thought nothing became him more . it was with him of so simple yet so dignified a nature . she could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction . it spoke such perfect amity . he left them immediately afterwards gone in a moment . he always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance . emma could not regret her having gone to miss bates but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlierit would have been a great pleasure to talk over jane fairfaxs situation with mr .  knightley . neither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyedbut it might have happened at a better timeand to have had longer notice of it would have been pleasanter . they parted thorough friends however she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance and his unfinished gallantryit was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion . he had been sitting with them half an hour she found . it was a pity that she had not come back earlier in the hope of diverting her fathers thoughts from the disagreeableness of mr .  knightleys going to london and going so suddenly and going on horseback which she knew would be all very bad emma communicated her news of jane fairfax and her dependence on the effect was justified it supplied a very useful check interested without disturbing him . he had long made up his mind to jane fairfaxs going out as governess and could talk of it cheerfully but mr .  knightleys going to london had been an unexpected blow . i am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably settled . mrs .  elton is very goodnatured and agreeable and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be . i hope it is a dry situation and that her health will be taken good care of . it ought to be a first object as i am sure poor miss taylors always was with me . you know my dear she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us . and i hope she will be better off in one respect and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long . the following day brought news from richmond to throw every thing else into the background . an express arrived at randalls to announce the death of mrs .  churchill though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account she had not lived above sixandthirty hours after his return . a sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state had carried her off after a short struggle . the great mrs .  churchill was no more . it was felt as such things must be felt . every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow tenderness towards the departed solicitude for the surviving friends and in a reasonable time curiosity to know where she would be buried . goldsmith tells us that when lovely woman stoops to folly she has nothing to do but to die and when she stoops to be disagreeable it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of illfame . mrs .  churchill after being disliked at least twentyfive years was now spoken of with compassionate allowances . in one point she was fully justified . she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill .  the event acquitted her of all the fancifulness and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints . poor mrs .  churchill no doubt she had been suffering a great deal more than any body had ever supposedand continual pain would try the temper . it was a sad eventa great shockwith all her faults what would mr .  churchill do without her mr .  churchills loss would be dreadful indeed . mr .  churchill would never get over it . even mr .  weston shook his head and looked solemn and said ah poor woman who would have thought it and resolved that his mourning should be as handsome as possible and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense true and steady . how it would affect frank was among the earliest thoughts of both . it was also a very early speculation with emma . the character of mrs .  churchill the grief of her husbandher mind glanced over them both with awe and compassionand then rested with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event how benefited how freed . she saw in a moment all the possible good . now an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter . mr .  churchill independent of his wife was feared by nobody an easy guidable man to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew . all that remained to be wished was that the nephew should form the attachment as with all her goodwill in the cause emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed . harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion with great selfcommand . what ever she might feel of brighter hope she betrayed nothing . emma was gratified to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance . they spoke therefore of mrs .  churchills death with mutual forbearance . short letters from frank were received at randalls communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans . mr .  churchill was better than could be expected and their first removal on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire was to be to the house of a very old friend in windsor to whom mr .  churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years . at present there was nothing to be done for harriet good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on emmas side . it was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax whose prospects were closing while harriets opened and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury who wished to shew her kindnessand with emma it was grown into a first wish . she had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness and the person whom she had been so many months neglecting was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy . she wanted to be of use to her wanted to shew a value for her society and testify respect and consideration . she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield . a note was written to urge it . the invitation was refused and by a verbal message . miss fairfax was not well enough to write and when mr .  perry called at hartfield the same morning it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited though against her own consent by himself and that she was suffering under severe headaches and a nervous fever to a degree which made him doubt the possibility of her going to mrs .  smallridges at the time proposed . her health seemed for the moment completely deranged appetite quite goneand though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms nothing touching the pulmonary complaint which was the standing apprehension of the family mr .  perry was uneasy about her . he thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to and that she felt it so herself though she would not own it . her spirits seemed overcome . her present home he could not but observe was unfavourable to a nervous disorder confined always to one roomhe could have wished it otherwise and her good aunt though his very old friend he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description . her care and attention could not be questioned they were in fact only too great . he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more evil than good from them . emma listened with the warmest concern grieved for her more and more and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful . to take herbe it only an hour or twofrom her aunt to give her change of air and scene and quiet rational conversation even for an hour or two might do her good and the following morning she wrote again to say in the most feeling language she could command that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would name mentioning that she had mr .  perrys decided opinion in favour of such exercise for his patient . the answer was only in this short note miss fairfaxs compliments and thanks but is quite unequal to any exercise . emma felt that her own note had deserved something better but it was impossible to quarrel with words whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted . in spite of the answer therefore she ordered the carriage and drove to mrs .  batess in the hope that jane would be induced to join her but it would not domiss bates came to the carriage door all gratitude and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest serviceand every thing that message could do was tried but all in vain . miss bates was obliged to return without success jane was quite unpersuadable the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse . emma wished she could have seen her and tried her own powers but almost before she could hint the wish miss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let miss woodhouse in . indeed the truth was that poor dear jane could not bear to see any bodyany body at all mrs .  elton indeed could not be deniedand mrs .  cole had made such a pointand mrs .  perry had said so muchbut except them jane would really see nobody . emma did not want to be classed with the mrs .  eltons the mrs .  perrys and the mrs .  coles who would force themselves anywhere neither could she feel any right of preference herself she submitted therefore and only questioned miss bates farther as to her nieces appetite and diet which she longed to be able to assist . on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy and very communicative jane would hardly eat any thing mr .  perry recommended nourishing food but every thing they could command and never had any body such good neighbours was distasteful . emma on reaching home called the housekeeper directly to an examination of her stores and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note . in half an hour the arrowroot was returned with a thousand thanks from miss bates but dear jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back it was a thing she could not takeand moreover she insisted on her saying that she was not at all in want of any thing . when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows at some distance from highbury on the afternoon of the very day on which she had under the plea of being unequal to any exercise so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage she could have no doubtputting every thing together that jane was resolved to receive no kindness from her . she was sorry very sorry . her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits inconsistency of action and inequality of powers and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling or esteemed so little worthy as a friend but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good and of being able to say to herself that could mr .  knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting jane fairfax could he even have seen into her heart he would not on this occasion have found any thing to reprove . chapter x one morning about ten days after mrs .  churchills decease emma was called downstairs to mr .  weston who could not stay five minutes and wanted particularly to speak with her . he met her at the parlourdoor and hardly asking her how she did in the natural key of his voice sunk it immediately to say unheard by her father can you come to randalls at any time this morningdo if it be possible . mrs .  weston wants to see you . she must see you . is she unwell no no not at allonly a little agitated . she would have ordered the carriage and come to you but she must see you alone and that you knownodding towards her fatherhumphcan you come certainly . this moment if you please . it is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way . but what can be the matter is she really not ill depend upon mebut ask no more questions . you will know it all in time . the most unaccountable business but hush hush to guess what all this meant was impossible even for emma . something really important seemed announced by his looks but as her friend was well she endeavoured not to be uneasy and settling it with her father that she would take her walk now she and mr .  weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for randalls . nowsaid emma when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates now mr .  weston do let me know what has happened . no nohe gravely replied . dont ask me . i promised my wife to leave it all to her . she will break it to you better than i can . do not be impatient emma it will all come out too soon . break it to me cried emma standing still with terror . good godmr . weston tell me at once . something has happened in brunswick square . i know it has . tell me i charge you tell me this moment what it is . no indeed you are mistaken . mr .  weston do not trifle with me . consider how many of my dearest friends are now in brunswick square . which of them is it i charge you by all that is sacred not to attempt concealment . upon my word emma . your wordwhy not your honourwhy not say upon your honour that it has nothing to do with any of them good heavenswhat can be to be broke to me that does not relate to one of that family upon my honour said he very seriously it does not . it is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of knightley . emmas courage returned and she walked on . i was wrong he continued in talking of its being broke to you . i should not have used the expression . in fact it does not concern you it concerns only myselfthat is we hope . humphin short my dear emma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it . i dont say that it is not a disagreeable businessbut things might be much worse . if we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls . emma found that she must wait and now it required little effort . she asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concernsomething just come to light of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the familysomething which the late event at richmond had brought forward . her fancy was very active . half a dozen natural children perhapsand poor frank cut off this though very undesirable would be no matter of agony to her . it inspired little more than an animating curiosity . who is that gentleman on horseback said she as they proceeded speaking more to assist mr .  weston in keeping his secret than with any other view . i do not know . one of the otways . not frankit is not frank i assure you . you will not see him . he is half way to windsor by this time . has your son been with you then oh yesdid not you knowwell well never mind . for a moment he was silent and then added in a tone much more guarded and demure yes frank came over this morning just to ask us how we did . they hurried on and were speedily at randalls . well my dear said he as they entered the roomi have brought her and now i hope you will soon be better . i shall leave you together . there is no use in delay . i shall not be far off if you want me . and emma distinctly heard him add in a lower tone before he quitted the roomi have been as good as my word . she has not the least idea . mrs .  weston was looking so ill and had an air of so much perturbation that emmas uneasiness increased and the moment they were alone she eagerly said what is it my dear friend something of a very unpleasant nature i find has occurreddo let me know directly what it is . i have been walking all this way in complete suspense . we both abhor suspense . do not let mine continue longer . it will do you good to speak of your distress whatever it may be . have you indeed no idea said mrs .  weston in a trembling voice . cannot you my dear emmacannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear so far as that it relates to mr .  frank churchill i do guess . you are right . it does relate to him and i will tell you directly resuming her work and seeming resolved against looking up . he has been here this very morning on a most extraordinary errand . it is impossible to express our surprize . he came to speak to his father on a subjectto announce an attachment she stopped to breathe . emma thought first of herself and then of harriet . more than an attachment indeed resumed mrs .  weston an engagement a positive engagement . what will you say emmawhat will any body say when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are engagednay that they have been long engaged emma even jumped with surprizeand horrorstruck exclaimed jane fairfaxgood god you are not serious you do not mean it you may well be amazed returned mrs .  weston still averting her eyes and talking on with eagerness that emma might have time to recover you may well be amazed . but it is even so . there has been a solemn engagement between them ever since octoberformed at weymouth and kept a secret from every body . not a creature knowing it but themselvesneither the campbells nor her family nor his . it is so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact it is yet almost incredible to myself . i can hardly believe it . i thought i knew him . emma scarcely heard what was said . her mind was divided between two ideasher own former conversations with him about miss fairfax and poor harrietand for some time she could only exclaim and require confirmation repeated confirmation . well said she at last trying to recover herself this is a circumstance which i must think of at least half a day before i can at all comprehend it . whatengaged to her all the winter before either of them came to highbury engaged since octobersecretly engaged . it has hurt me emma very much . it has hurt his father equally . some part of his conduct we cannot excuse . emma pondered a moment and then replied i will not pretend not to understand you and to give you all the relief in my power be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me as you are apprehensive of . mrs .  weston looked up afraid to believe but emmas countenance was as steady as her words . that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my present perfect indifference she continued i will farther tell you that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance when i did like him when i was very much disposed to be attached to himnay was attachedand how it came to cease is perhaps the wonder . fortunately however it did cease . i have really for some time past for at least these three months cared nothing about him . you may believe me mrs .  weston . this is the simple truth . mrs .  weston kissed her with tears of joy and when she could find utterance assured her that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do . mr .  weston will be almost as much relieved as myself said she . on this point we have been wretched . it was our darling wish that you might be attached to each otherand we were persuaded that it was so . imagine what we have been feeling on your account . i have escaped and that i should escape may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself . but this does not acquit him mrs .  weston and i must say that i think him greatly to blame . what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged and with manners so very disengaged what right had he to endeavour to please as he certainly didto distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention as he certainly didwhile he really belonged to anotherhow could he tell what mischief he might be doing how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him very wrong very wrong indeed . from something that he said my dear emma i rather imagine and how could she bear such behaviour composure with a witness to look on while repeated attentions were offering to another woman before her face and not resent it . that is a degree of placidity which i can neither comprehend nor respect . there were misunderstandings between them emma he said so expressly . he had not time to enter into much explanation . he was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said . the present crisis indeed seemed to be brought on by them and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct . impropriety oh mrs .  westonit is too calm a censure . much much beyond improprietyit has sunk him i cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion . so unlike what a man should be none of that upright integrity that strict adherence to truth and principle that disdain of trick and littleness which a man should display in every transaction of his life . nay dear emma now i must take his part for though he has been wrong in this instance i have known him long enough to answer for his having many very many good qualities and good god cried emma not attending to her . mrs . smallridge too jane actually on the point of going as governess what could he mean by such horrible indelicacy to suffer her to engage herself to suffer her even to think of such a measure he knew nothing about it emma . on this article i can fully acquit him . it was a private resolution of hers not communicated to himor at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction . till yesterday i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans . they burst on him i do not know how but by some letter or message and it was the discovery of what she was doing of this very project of hers which determined him to come forward at once own it all to his uncle throw himself on his kindness and in short put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long . emma began to listen better . i am to hear from him soon continued mrs .  weston . he told me at parting that he should soon write and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now . let us wait therefore for this letter . it may bring many extenuations . it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood . dont let us be severe dont let us be in a hurry to condemn him . let us have patience . i must love him and now that i am satisfied on one point the one material point i am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well and ready to hope that it may . they must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment . his sufferings replied emma dryly do not appear to have done him much harm . well and how did mr .  churchill take it most favourably for his nephewgave his consent with scarcely a difficulty . conceive what the events of a week have done in that family while poor mrs .  churchill lived i suppose there could not have been a hope a chance a possibilitybut scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required . what a blessing it is when undue influence does not survive the grave he gave his consent with very little persuasion . ah thought emma he would have done as much for harriet . this was settled last night and frank was off with the light this morning . he stopped at highbury at the batess i fancy some timeand then came on hither but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle to whom he is just now more necessary than ever that as i tell you he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour . he was very much agitatedvery much indeedto a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing i had ever seen him before . in addition to all the rest there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell which he had had no previous suspicion of and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal . and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresythe campbells the dixons did none of them know of the engagement emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush . none not one . he positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves . well said emma i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea and i wish them very happy . but i shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding . what has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceitespionage and treachery to come among us with professions of openness and simplicity and such a league in secret to judge us allhere have we been the whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear . they must take the consequence if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable i am quite easy on that head replied mrs .  weston . i am very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other which both might not have heard . you are in luck . your only blunder was confined to my ear when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady . true . but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax i never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her and as to speaking ill of him there i must have been safe . at this moment mr .  weston appeared at a little distance from the window evidently on the watch . his wife gave him a look which invited him in and while he was coming round added now dearest emma let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match . let us make the best of itand indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour . it is not a connexion to gratify but if mr .  churchill does not feel that why should we and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for and still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right . and how much may be said in her situation for even that error much indeed cried emma feelingly . if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation like jane fairfaxs . of such one may almost say that the world is not theirs nor the worlds law . she met mr .  weston on his entrance with a smiling countenance exclaiming a very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word this was a device i suppose to sport with my curiosity and exercise my talent of guessing . but you really frightened me . i thought you had lost half your property at least . and here instead of its being a matter of condolence it turns out to be one of congratulation . i congratulate you mr .  weston with all my heart on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter . a glance or two between him and his wife convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate . his air and voice recovered their usual briskness he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand and entered on the subject in a manner to prove that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing . his companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence or smooth objections and by the time they had talked it all over together and he had talked it all over again with emma in their walk back to hartfield he was become perfectly reconciled and not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank could possibly have done . chapter xi harriet poor harrietthose were the words in them lay the tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of and which constituted the real misery of the business to her . frank churchill had behaved very ill by herselfvery ill in many waysbut it was not so much his behaviour as her own which made her so angry with him . it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriets account that gave the deepest hue to his offence . poor harriet to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery . mr .  knightley had spoken prophetically when he once said emma you have been no friend to harriet smith . she was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice . it was true that she had not to charge herself in this instance as in the former with being the sole and original author of the mischief with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered harriets imagination for harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed . she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments . her influence would have been enough . and now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them . she felt that she had been risking her friends happiness on most insufficient grounds . common sense would have directed her to tell harriet that she must not allow herself to think of him and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her . but with common sense she added i am afraid i have had little to do . she was extremely angry with herself . if she could not have been angry with frank churchill too it would have been dreadful . as for jane fairfax she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account . harriet would be anxiety enough she need no longer be unhappy about jane whose troubles and whose illhealth having of course the same origin must be equally under cure . her days of insignificance and evil were over . she would soon be well and happy and prosperous . emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted . this discovery laid many smaller matters open . no doubt it had been from jealousy . in janes eyes she had been a rival and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed . an airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison . she understood it all and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings she acknowledged that jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert . but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge there was little sympathy to be spared for any body else . emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first . considering the very superior claims of the object it ought and judging by its apparently stronger effect on harriets mind producing reserve and selfcommand it would . she must communicate the painful truth however and as soon as possible . an injunction of secresy had been among mr .  westons parting words . for the present the whole affair was to be completely a secret . mr .  churchill had made a point of it as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum . emma had promised but still harriet must be excepted . it was her superior duty . in spite of her vexation she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by harriet which mrs .  weston had just gone through by herself . the intelligence which had been so anxiously announced to her she was now to be anxiously announcing to another . her heart beat quick on hearing harriets footstep and voice so she supposed had poor mrs .  weston felt when she was approaching randalls . could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance but of that unfortunately there could be no chance . well miss woodhouse cried harriet coming eagerly into the room is not this the oddest news that ever was what news do you mean replied emma unable to guess by look or voice whether harriet could indeed have received any hint . about jane fairfax . did you ever hear any thing so strange ohyou need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr .  weston has told me himself . i met him just now . he told me it was to be a great secret and therefore i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you but he said you knew it . what did mr .  weston tell yousaid emma still perplexed . oh he told me all about it that jane fairfax and mr .  frank churchill are to be married and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while . how very odd it was indeed so odd harriets behaviour was so extremely odd that emma did not know how to understand it . her character appeared absolutely changed . she seemed to propose shewing no agitation or disappointment or peculiar concern in the discovery . emma looked at her quite unable to speak . had you any idea cried harriet of his being in love with heryou perhaps might . you blushing as she spoke who can see into every bodys heart but nobody else upon my word said emma i begin to doubt my having any such talent . can you seriously ask me harriet whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i wastacitly if not openly encouraging you to give way to your own feelingsi never had the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr .  frank churchills having the least regard for jane fairfax . you may be very sure that if i had i should have cautioned you accordingly . me cried harriet colouring and astonished . why should you caution meyou do not think i care about mr .  frank churchill . i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject replied emma smiling but you do not mean to deny that there was a timeand not very distant eitherwhen you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him himnever never . dear miss woodhouse how could you so mistake me turning away distressed . harriet cried emma after a moments pausewhat do you mean good heaven what do you meanmistake youam i to suppose then she could not speak another word . her voice was lost and she sat down waiting in great terror till harriet should answer . harriet who was standing at some distance and with face turned from her did not immediately say any thing and when she did speak it was in a voice nearly as agitated as emmas . i should not have thought it possible she began that you could have misunderstood me i know we agreed never to name him but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person . mr .  frank churchill indeed i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other . i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr .  frank churchill who is like nobody by his side . and that you should have been so mistaken is amazingi am sure but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost to dare to think of him . at first if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened that there had been matches of greater disparity those were your very words i should not have dared to give way toi should not have thought it possiblebut if you who had been always acquainted with him harriet cried emma collecting herself resolutelylet us understand each other now without the possibility of farther mistake . are you speaking ofmr . knightley to be sure i am . i never could have an idea of any body else and so i thought you knew . when we talked about him it was as clear as possible . not quite returned emma with forced calmness for all that you then said appeared to me to relate to a different person . i could almost assert that you had named mr .  frank churchill . i am sure the service mr .  frank churchill had rendered you in protecting you from the gipsies was spoken of . oh miss woodhouse how you do forget my dear harriet i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion . i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment that considering the service he had rendered you it was extremely naturaland you agreed to it expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue . the impression of it is strong on my memory . oh dear cried harriet now i recollect what you mean but i was thinking of something very different at the time . it was not the gipsiesit was not mr .  frank churchill that i meant . no with some elevation i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance of mr .  knightleys coming and asking me to dance when mr .  elton would not stand up with me and when there was no other partner in the room . that was the kind action that was the noble benevolence and generosity that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth . good god cried emma this has been a most unfortunate most deplorable mistakewhat is to be done you would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me at least however i cannot be worse off than i should have been if the other had been the person and nowit is possible she paused a few moments . emma could not speak . i do not wonder miss woodhouse she resumed that you should feel a great difference between the two as to me or as to any body . you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other . but i hope miss woodhouse that supposingthat if strange as it may appear . but you know they were your own words that more wonderful things had happened matches of greater disparity had taken place than between mr .  frank churchill and me and therefore it seems as if such a thing even as this may have occurred before and if i should be so fortunate beyond expression as to if mr .  knightley should reallyif he does not mind the disparity i hope dear miss woodhouse you will not set yourself against it and try to put difficulties in the way . but you are too good for that i am sure . harriet was standing at one of the windows . emma turned round to look at her in consternation and hastily said have you any idea of mr .  knightleys returning your affection yes replied harriet modestly but not fearfullyi must say that i have . emmas eyes were instantly withdrawn and she sat silently meditating in a fixed attitude for a few minutes . a few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart . a mind like hers once opening to suspicion made rapid progress . she touched she admittedshe acknowledged the whole truth . why was it so much worse that harriet should be in love with mr .  knightley than with frank churchill why was the evil so dreadfully increased by harriets having some hope of a return it darted through her with the speed of an arrow that mr .  knightley must marry no one but herself her own conduct as well as her own heart was before her in the same few minutes . she saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before . how improperly had she been acting by harriet how inconsiderate how indelicate how irrational how unfeeling had been her conduct what blindness what madness had led her on it struck her with dreadful force and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world . some portion of respect for herself however in spite of all these demerits some concern for her own appearance and a strong sense of justice by harrietthere would be no need of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved by mr .  knightleybut justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now gave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness with even apparent kindness . for her own advantage indeed it was fit that the utmost extent of harriets hopes should be enquired into and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintainedor to deserve to be slighted by the person whose counsels had never led her right . rousing from reflection therefore and subduing her emotion she turned to harriet again and in a more inviting accent renewed the conversation for as to the subject which had first introduced it the wonderful story of jane fairfax that was quite sunk and lost . neither of them thought but of mr .  knightley and themselves . harriet who had been standing in no unhappy reverie was yet very glad to be called from it by the now encouraging manner of such a judge and such a friend as miss woodhouse and only wanted invitation to give the history of her hopes with great though trembling delight . emmas tremblings as she asked and as she listened were better concealed than harriets but they were not less . her voice was not unsteady but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self such a burst of threatening evil such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions must create . she listened with much inward suffering but with great outward patience to harriets detail . methodical or well arranged or very well delivered it could not be expected to be but it contained when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration a substance to sink her spirit especially with the corroborating circumstances which her own memory brought in favour of mr .  knightleys most improved opinion of harriet . harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances . emma knew that he had on that occasion found her much superior to his expectation . from that evening or at least from the time of miss woodhouses encouraging her to think of him harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her a manner of kindness and sweetnesslatterly she had been more and more aware of it . when they had been all walking together he had so often come and walked by her and talked so very delightfullyhe seemed to want to be acquainted with her . emma knew it to have been very much the case . she had often observed the change to almost the same extent . harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of harriet . he praised her for being without art or affectation for having simple honest generous feelings . she knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet he had dwelt on them to her more than once . much that lived in harriets memory many little particulars of the notice she had received from him a look a speech a removal from one chair to another a compliment implied a preference inferred had been unnoticed because unsuspected by emma . circumstances that might swell to half an hours relation and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned the two of strongest promise to harriet were not without some degree of witness from emma herself . the first was his walking with her apart from the others in the limewalk at donwell where they had been walking some time before emma came and he had taken pains as she was convinced to draw her from the rest to himselfand at first he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before in a very particular way indeedharriet could not recall it without a blush . he seemed to be almost asking her whether her affections were engaged . but as soon as she miss woodhouse appeared likely to join them he changed the subject and began talking about farming the second was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before emma came back from her visit the very last morning of his being at hartfieldthough when he first came in he had said that he could not stay five minutesand his having told her during their conversation that though he must go to london it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all which was much more as emma felt than he had acknowledged to her . the superior degree of confidence towards harriet which this one article marked gave her severe pain . on the subject of the first of the two circumstances she did after a little reflection venture the following question . might he notis not it possible that when enquiring as you thought into the state of your affections he might be alluding to mr .  martin he might have mr .  martins interest in view but harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit . mr .  martin no indeedthere was not a hint of mr .  martin . i hope i know better now than to care for mr .  martin or to be suspected of it . when harriet had closed her evidence she appealed to her dear miss woodhouse to say whether she had not good ground for hope . i never should have presumed to think of it at first said she but for you . you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour be the rule of mineand so i have . but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so very wonderful . the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech the many bitter feelings made the utmost exertion necessary on emmas side to enable her to say on reply harriet i will only venture to declare that mr .  knightley is the last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does . harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness which at that moment would have been dreadful penance by the sound of her fathers footsteps . he was coming through the hall . harriet was too much agitated to encounter him . she could not compose herself mr .  woodhouse would be alarmedshe had better gowith most ready encouragement from her friend therefore she passed off through another doorand the moment she was gone this was the spontaneous burst of emmas feelings oh god that i had never seen her the rest of the day the following night were hardly enough for her thoughts . she was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours . every moment had brought a fresh surprize and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her . how to understand it all how to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself and living underthe blunders the blindness of her own head and heartshe sat still she walked about she tried her own room she tried the shrubberyin every place every posture she perceived that she had acted most weakly that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying that she was wretched and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness . to understand thoroughly understand her own heart was the first endeavour . to that point went every leisure moment which her fathers claims on her allowed and every moment of involuntary absence of mind . how long had mr .  knightley been so dear to her as every feeling declared him now to be when had his influence such influence begun when had he succeeded to that place in her affection which frank churchill had once for a short period occupiedshe looked back she compared the twocompared them as they had always stood in her estimation from the time of the latters becoming known to her and as they must at any time have been compared by her had it oh had it by any blessed felicity occurred to her to institute the comparison . she saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider mr .  knightley as infinitely the superior or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear . she saw that in persuading herself in fancying in acting to the contrary she had been entirely under a delusion totally ignorant of her own heartand in short that she had never really cared for frank churchill at all this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection . this was the knowledge of herself on the first question of inquiry which she reached and without being long in reaching it . she was most sorrowfully indignant ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to herher affection for mr .  knightley . every other part of her mind was disgusting . with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every bodys feelings with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every bodys destiny . she was proved to have been universally mistaken and she had not quite done nothingfor she had done mischief . she had brought evil on harriet on herself and she too much feared on mr .  knightley . were this most unequal of all connexions to take place on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning for his attachment she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of harrietsand even were this not the case he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly . mr .  knightley and harriet smithit was a union to distance every wonder of the kind . the attachment of frank churchill and jane fairfax became commonplace threadbare stale in the comparison exciting no surprize presenting no disparity affording nothing to be said or thought . mr . knightley and harriet smithsuch an elevation on her side such a debasement on his it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion to foresee the smiles the sneers the merriment it would prompt at his expense the mortification and disdain of his brother the thousand inconveniences to himself . could it beno it was impossible . and yet it was far very far from impossible . was it a new circumstance for a man of firstrate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers was it new for one perhaps too busy to seek to be the prize of a girl who would seek himwas it new for any thing in this world to be unequal inconsistent incongruousor for chance and circumstance as second causes to direct the human fate oh had she never brought harriet forward had she left her where she ought and where he had told her she oughthad she not with a folly which no tongue could express prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong all would have been safe none of this dreadful sequel would have been . how harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to mr .  knightleyhow she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it but harriet was less humble had fewer scruples than formerly . her inferiority whether of mind or situation seemed little felt . she had seemed more sensible of mr .  eltons being to stoop in marrying her than she now seemed of mr .  knightleys . alas was not that her own doing too who had been at pains to give harriet notions of selfconsequence but herselfwho but herself had taught her that she was to elevate herself if possible and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment if harriet from being humble were grown vain it was her doing too . chapter xii till now that she was threatened with its loss emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being first with mr .  knightley first in interest and affection . satisfied that it was so and feeling it her due she had enjoyed it without reflection and only in the dread of being supplanted found how inexpressibly important it had been . long very long she felt she had been first for having no female connexions of his own there had been only isabella whose claims could be compared with hers and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella . she had herself been first with him for many years past . she had not deserved it she had often been negligent or perverse slighting his advice or even wilfully opposing him insensible of half his merits and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her ownbut still from family attachment and habit and thorough excellence of mind he had loved her and watched over her from a girl with an endeavour to improve her and an anxiety for her doing right which no other creature had at all shared . in spite of all her faults she knew she was dear to him might she not say very dear when the suggestions of hope however which must follow here presented themselves she could not presume to indulge them . harriet smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly exclusively passionately loved by mr .  knightley . she could not . she could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to her . she had received a very recent proof of its impartiality . how shocked had he been by her behaviour to miss bates how directly how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subjectnot too strongly for the offencebut far far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clearsighted goodwill . she had no hope nothing to deserve the name of hope that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question but there was a hope at times a slight one at times much stronger that harriet might have deceived herself and be overrating his regard for her . wish it she must for his sakebe the consequence nothing to herself but his remaining single all his life . could she be secure of that indeed of his never marrying at all she believed she should be perfectly satisfied . let him but continue the same mr .  knightley to her and her father the same mr .  knightley to all the world let donwell and hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence and her peace would be fully secured . marriage in fact would not do for her . it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father and with what she felt for him . nothing should separate her from her father . she would not marry even if she were asked by mr .  knightley . it must be her ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed and she hoped that when able to see them together again she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were . she should see them henceforward with the closest observance and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here . he was expected back every day . the power of observation would be soon givenfrightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course . in the meanwhile she resolved against seeing harriet . it would do neither of them good it would do the subject no good to be talking of it farther . she was resolved not to be convinced as long as she could doubt and yet had no authority for opposing harriets confidence . to talk would be only to irritate . she wrote to her therefore kindly but decisively to beg that she would not at present come to hartfield acknowledging it to be her conviction that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better be avoided and hoping that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again except in the company of othersshe objected only to a teteatetethey might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday . harriet submitted and approved and was grateful . this point was just arranged when a visitor arrived to tear emmas thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them sleeping or waking the last twentyfour hoursmrs . weston who had been calling on her daughterinlaw elect and took hartfield in her way home almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview . mr .  weston had accompanied her to mrs .  batess and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely but she having then induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing was now returned with much more to say and much more to say with satisfaction than a quarter of an hour spent in mrs .  batess parlour with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings could have afforded . a little curiosity emma had and she made the most of it while her friend related . mrs .  weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present to be allowed merely to write to miss fairfax instead and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed and mr .  churchill could be reconciled to the engagements becoming known as considering every thing she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports but mr .  weston had thought differently he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her family and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it or if it were that it would be of any consequence for such things he observed always got about . emma smiled and felt that mr .  weston had very good reason for saying so . they had gone in shortand very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady . she had hardly been able to speak a word and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness . the quiet heartfelt satisfaction of the old lady and the rapturous delight of her daughterwho proved even too joyous to talk as usual had been a gratifying yet almost an affecting scene . they were both so truly respectable in their happiness so disinterested in every sensation thought so much of jane so much of every body and so little of themselves that every kindly feeling was at work for them . miss fairfaxs recent illness had offered a fair plea for mrs .  weston to invite her to an airing she had drawn back and declined at first but on being pressed had yielded and in the course of their drive mrs .  weston had by gentle encouragement overcome so much of her embarrassment as to bring her to converse on the important subject . apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr .  weston must necessarily open the cause but when these effusions were put by they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement . mrs .  weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject . on the misery of what she had suffered during the concealment of so many months continued mrs .  weston she was energetic . this was one of her expressions . i will not say that since i entered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments but i can say that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour and the quivering lip emma which uttered it was an attestation that i felt at my heart . poor girl said emma . she thinks herself wrong then for having consented to a private engagement wrong no one i believe can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself . the consequence said she has been a state of perpetual suffering to me and so it ought . but after all the punishment that misconduct can bring it is still not less misconduct . pain is no expiation . i never can be blameless . i have been acting contrary to all my sense of right and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken and the kindness i am now receiving is what my conscience tells me ought not to be . do not imagine madam she continued that i was taught wrong . do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up . the error has been all my own and i do assure you that with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give i shall yet dread making the story known to colonel campbell . poor girl said emma again . she loves him then excessively i suppose . it must have been from attachment only that she could be led to form the engagement . her affection must have overpowered her judgment . yes i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him . i am afraid returned emma sighing that i must often have contributed to make her unhappy . on your side my love it was very innocently done . but she probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before . one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in she said was that of making her unreasonable . the consciousness of having done amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been that had beenhard for him to bear . i did not make the allowances said she which i ought to have done for his temper and spirits his delightful spirits and that gaiety that playfulness of disposition which under any other circumstances would i am sure have been as constantly bewitching to me as they were at first . she then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected desired me whenever i had an opportunity to thank youi could not thank you too muchfor every wish and every endeavour to do her good . she was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself . if i did not know her to be happy now said emma seriously which in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she must be i could not bear these thanksfor oh mrs .  weston if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss fairfaxwell checking herself and trying to be more lively this is all to be forgotten . you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars . they shew her to the greatest advantage . i am sure she is very good i hope she will be very happy . it is fit that the fortune should be on his side for i think the merit will be all on hers . such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs .  weston . she thought well of frank in almost every respect and what was more she loved him very much and her defence was therefore earnest . she talked with a great deal of reason and at least equal affection but she had too much to urge for emmas attention it was soon gone to brunswick square or to donwell she forgot to attempt to listen and when mrs .  weston ended with we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but i hope it will soon come she was obliged to pause before she answered and at last obliged to answer at random before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for . are you well my emma was mrs .  westons parting question . oh perfectly . i am always well you know . be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible . mrs .  westons communications furnished emma with more food for unpleasant reflection by increasing her esteem and compassion and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax . she bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been in some measure the cause . had she followed mr .  knightleys known wishes in paying that attention to miss fairfax which was every way her due had she tried to know her better had she done her part towards intimacy had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith she must in all probability have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now . birth abilities and education had been equally marking one as an associate for her to be received with gratitude and the otherwhat was shesupposing even that they had never become intimate friends that she had never been admitted into miss fairfaxs confidence on this important matter which was most probablestill in knowing her as she ought and as she might she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to mr .  dixon which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself but had so unpardonably imparted an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of janes feelings by the levity or carelessness of frank churchills . of all the sources of evil surrounding the former since her coming to highbury she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst . she must have been a perpetual enemy . they never could have been all three together without her having stabbed jane fairfaxs peace in a thousand instances and on box hill perhaps it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more . the evening of this day was very long and melancholy at hartfield . the weather added what it could of gloom . a cold stormy rain set in and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs which the wind was despoiling and the length of the day which only made such cruel sights the longer visible . the weather affected mr .  woodhouse and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughters side and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before . it reminded her of their first forlorn teteatete on the evening of mrs .  westons weddingday but mr .  knightley had walked in then soon after tea and dissipated every melancholy fancy . alas such delightful proofs of hartfields attraction as those sort of visits conveyed might shortly be over . the picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter had proved erroneous no friends had deserted them no pleasures had been lost . but her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction . the prospect before her now was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled that might not be even partially brightened . if all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends hartfield must be comparatively deserted and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness . the child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself and mrs .  westons heart and time would be occupied by it . they should lose her and probably in great measure her husband also . frank churchill would return among them no more and miss fairfax it was reasonable to suppose would soon cease to belong to highbury . they would be married and settled either at or near enscombe . all that were good would be withdrawn and if to these losses the loss of donwell were to be added what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach mr .  knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort no longer walking in at all hours as if ever willing to change his own home for theirshow was it to be endured and if he were to be lost to them for harriets sake if he were to be thought of hereafter as finding in harriets society all that he wanted if harriet were to be the chosen the first the dearest the friend the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence what could be increasing emmas wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind that it had been all her own work when it came to such a pitch as this she was not able to refrain from a start or a heavy sigh or even from walking about the room for a few secondsand the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn was in the resolution of her own better conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past it would yet find her more rational more acquainted with herself and leave her less to regret when it were gone . chapter xiii the weather continued much the same all the following morning and the same loneliness and the same melancholy seemed to reign at hartfieldbut in the afternoon it cleared the wind changed into a softer quarter the clouds were carried off the sun appeared it was summer again . with all the eagerness which such a transition gives emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible . never had the exquisite sight smell sensation of nature tranquil warm and brilliant after a storm been more attractive to her . she longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce and on mr .  perrys coming in soon after dinner with a disengaged hour to give her father she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery . there with spirits freshened and thoughts a little relieved she had taken a few turns when she saw mr .  knightley passing through the garden door and coming towards her . it was the first intimation of his being returned from london . she had been thinking of him the moment before as unquestionably sixteen miles distant . there was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind . she must be collected and calm . in half a minute they were together . the how dye dos were quiet and constrained on each side . she asked after their mutual friends they were all well . when had he left themonly that morning . he must have had a wet ride . yes . he meant to walk with her she found . he had just looked into the diningroom and as he was not wanted there preferred being out of doors . she thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully and the first possible cause for it suggested by her fears was that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother and was pained by the manner in which they had been received . they walked together . he was silent . she thought he was often looking at her and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give . and this belief produced another dread . perhaps he wanted to speak to her of his attachment to harriet he might be watching for encouragement to begin . she did not could not feel equal to lead the way to any such subject . he must do it all himself . yet she could not bear this silence . with him it was most unnatural . she consideredresolvedand trying to smile began you have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather surprize you . have i said he quietly and looking at her of what nature oh the best nature in the worlda wedding . after waiting a moment as if to be sure she intended to say no more he replied if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill i have heard that already . how is it possible cried emma turning her glowing cheeks towards him for while she spoke it occurred to her that he might have called at mrs .  goddards in his way . i had a few lines on parish business from mr .  weston this morning and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened . emma was quite relieved and could presently say with a little more composure you probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have had your suspicions . i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution . i wish i had attended to itbutwith a sinking voice and a heavy sigh i seem to have been doomed to blindness . for a moment or two nothing was said and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest till she found her arm drawn within his and pressed against his heart and heard him thus saying in a tone of great sensibility speaking low time my dearest emma time will heal the wound . your own excellent senseyour exertions for your fathers sakei know you will not allow yourself . her arm was pressed again as he added in a more broken and subdued accent the feelings of the warmest friendshipindignationabominable scoundrel and in a louder steadier tone he concluded with he will soon be gone . they will soon be in yorkshire . i am sorry for her . she deserves a better fate . emma understood him and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure excited by such tender consideration replied you are very kindbut you are mistakenand i must set you right . i am not in want of that sort of compassion . my blindness to what was going on led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier . emma cried he looking eagerly at her are you indeed but checking himselfno no i understand youforgive mei am pleased that you can say even so much . he is no object of regret indeed and it will not be very long i hope before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason . fortunate that your affections were not farther entangledi could never i confess from your manners assure myself as to the degree of what you felt i could only be certain that there was a preferenceand a preference which i never believed him to deserve . he is a disgrace to the name of man . and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman jane jane you will be a miserable creature . mr .  knightley said emma trying to be lively but really confused i am in a very extraordinary situation . i cannot let you continue in your error and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impression i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse . but i never have . he listened in perfect silence . she wished him to speak but he would not . she supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion . she went on however . i have very little to say for my own conduct . i was tempted by his attentions and allowed myself to appear pleased . an old story probablya common caseand no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as i do for understanding . many circumstances assisted the temptation . he was the son of mr .  westonhe was continually herei always found him very pleasantand in short for with a sigh let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously they all centre in this at lastmy vanity was flattered and i allowed his attentions . latterly howeverfor some time indeed i have had no idea of their meaning any thing . i thought them a habit a trick nothing that called for seriousness on my side . he has imposed on me but he has not injured me . i have never been attached to him . and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour . he never wished to attach me . it was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another . it was his object to blind all about him and no one i am sure could be more effectually blinded than myselfexcept that i was not blindedthat it was my good fortunethat in short i was somehow or other safe from him . she had hoped for an answer herefor a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible but he was silent and as far as she could judge deep in thought . at last and tolerably in his usual tone he said i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill . i can suppose however that i may have underrated him . my acquaintance with him has been but trifling . and even if i have not underrated him hitherto he may yet turn out well . with such a woman he has a chance . i have no motive for wishing him illand for her sake whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct i shall certainly wish him well . i have no doubt of their being happy together said emma i believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached . he is a most fortunate man returned mr .  knightley with energy . so early in lifeat threeandtwentya period when if a man chuses a wife he generally chuses ill .  at threeandtwenty to have drawn such a prize what years of felicity that man in all human calculation has before himassured of the love of such a womanthe disinterested love for jane fairfaxs character vouches for her disinterestedness every thing in his favour equality of situationi mean as far as regards society and all the habits and manners that are important equality in every point but one and that one since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants . a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from and he who can do it where there is no doubt of her regard must i think be the happiest of mortals . frank churchill is indeed the favourite of fortune . every thing turns out for his good . he meets with a young woman at a wateringplace gains her affection cannot even weary her by negligent treatmentand had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him they could not have found her superior . his aunt is in the way . his aunt dies . he has only to speak . his friends are eager to promote his happiness . he had used every body illand they are all delighted to forgive him . he is a fortunate man indeed you speak as if you envied him . and i do envy him emma . in one respect he is the object of my envy . emma could say no more . they seemed to be within half a sentence of harriet and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject if possible . she made her plan she would speak of something totally differentthe children in brunswick square and she only waited for breath to begin when mr .  knightley startled her by saying you will not ask me what is the point of envy . you are determined i see to have no curiosity . you are wisebut i cannot be wise . emma i must tell you what you will not ask though i may wish it unsaid the next moment . oh then dont speak it dont speak it she eagerly cried . take a little time consider do not commit yourself . thank you said he in an accent of deep mortification and not another syllable followed . emma could not bear to give him pain . he was wishing to confide in her perhaps to consult hercost her what it would she would listen . she might assist his resolution or reconcile him to it she might give just praise to harriet or by representing to him his own independence relieve him from that state of indecision which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his . they had reached the house . you are going in i suppose said he . noreplied emmaquite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spokei should like to take another turn . mr .  perry is not gone . and after proceeding a few steps she added i stopped you ungraciously just now mr .  knightley and i am afraid gave you pain . but if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplationas a friend indeed you may command me . i will hear whatever you like . i will tell you exactly what i think . as a friendrepeated mr .  knightley . emma that i fear is a wordno i have no wishstay yes why should i hesitate i have gone too far already for concealment . emma i accept your offer extraordinary as it may seem i accept it and refer myself to you as a friend . tell me then have i no chance of ever succeeding he stopped in his earnestness to look the question and the expression of his eyes overpowered her . my dearest emma said he for dearest you will always be whatever the event of this hours conversation my dearest most beloved emmatell me at once . say no if it is to be said . she could really say nothing . you are silent he cried with great animation absolutely silent at present i ask no more . emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment . the dread of being awakened from the happiest dream was perhaps the most prominent feeling . i cannot make speeches emma he soon resumed and in a tone of such sincere decided intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing . if i loved you less i might be able to talk about it more . but you know what i am . you hear nothing but truth from me . i have blamed you and lectured you and you have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it . bear with the truths i would tell you now dearest emma as well as you have borne with them . the manner perhaps may have as little to recommend them . god knows i have been a very indifferent lover . but you understand me . yes you see you understand my feelings and will return them if you can . at present i ask only to hear once to hear your voice . while he spoke emmas mind was most busy and with all the wonderful velocity of thought had been ableand yet without losing a word to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole to see that harriets hopes had been entirely groundless a mistake a delusion as complete a delusion as any of her ownthat harriet was nothing that she was every thing herself that what she had been saying relative to harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings and that her agitation her doubts her reluctance her discouragement had been all received as discouragement from herself . and not only was there time for these convictions with all their glow of attendant happiness there was time also to rejoice that harriets secret had not escaped her and to resolve that it need not and should not . it was all the service she could now render her poor friend for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to harriet as infinitely the most worthy of the two or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever without vouchsafing any motive because he could not marry them both emma had it not . she felt for harriet with pain and with contrition but no flight of generosity run mad opposing all that could be probable or reasonable entered her brain . she had led her friend astray and it would be a reproach to her for ever but her judgment was as strong as her feelings and as strong as it had ever been before in reprobating any such alliance for him as most unequal and degrading . her way was clear though not quite smooth . she spoke then on being so entreated . what did she sayjust what she ought of course . a lady always does . she said enough to shew there need not be despairand to invite him to say more himself . he had despaired at one period he had received such an injunction to caution and silence as for the time crushed every hopeshe had begun by refusing to hear him . the change had perhaps been somewhat suddenher proposal of taking another turn her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to might be a little extraordinaryshe felt its inconsistency but mr .  knightley was so obliging as to put up with it and seek no farther explanation . seldom very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised or a little mistaken but where as in this case though the conduct is mistaken the feelings are not it may not be very material . mr .  knightley could not impute to emma a more relenting heart than she possessed or a heart more disposed to accept of his . he had in fact been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence . he had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it . he had come in his anxiety to see how she bore frank churchills engagement with no selfish view no view at all but of endeavouring if she allowed him an opening to soothe or to counsel her . the rest had been the work of the moment the immediate effect of what he heard on his feelings . the delightful assurance of her total indifference towards frank churchill of her having a heart completely disengaged from him had given birth to the hope that in time he might gain her affection himselfbut it had been no present hopehe had only in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her . the superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting . the affection which he had been asking to be allowed to create if he could was already hiswithin half an hour he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind to something so like perfect happiness that it could bear no other name . her change was equal . this one halfhour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance jealousy or distrust . on his side there had been a longstanding jealousy old as the arrival or even the expectation of frank churchill . he had been in love with emma and jealous of frank churchill from about the same period one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other . it was his jealousy of frank churchill that had taken him from the country . the box hill party had decided him on going away . he would save himself from witnessing again such permitted encouraged attentions . he had gone to learn to be indifferent . but he had gone to a wrong place . there was too much domestic happiness in his brothers house woman wore too amiable a form in it isabella was too much like emmadiffering only in those striking inferiorities which always brought the other in brilliancy before him for much to have been done even had his time been longer . he had stayed on however vigorously day after daytill this very mornings post had conveyed the history of jane fairfax . then with the gladness which must be felt nay which he did not scruple to feel having never believed frank churchill to be at all deserving emma was there so much fond solicitude so much keen anxiety for her that he could stay no longer . he had ridden home through the rain and had walked up directly after dinner to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures faultless in spite of all her faults bore the discovery . he had found her agitated and low . frank churchill was a villain . he heard her declare that she had never loved him . frank churchills character was not desperate . she was his own emma by hand and word when they returned into the house and if he could have thought of frank churchill then he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow . chapter xiv what totally different feelings did emma take back into the house from what she had brought outshe had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of sufferingshe was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away . they sat down to teathe same party round the same table how often it had been collectedand how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sunbut never in such a state of spirits never in any thing like it and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house or even the attentive daughter . poor mr .  woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride . could he have seen the heart he would have cared very little for the lungs but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from mr .  perry and talked on with much selfcontentment totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return . as long as mr .  knightley remained with them emmas fever continued but when he was gone she began to be a little tranquillised and subduedand in the course of the sleepless night which was the tax for such an evening she found one or two such very serious points to consider as made her feel that even her happiness must have some alloy . her fatherand harriet . she could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost was the question . with respect to her father it was a question soon answered . she hardly knew yet what mr .  knightley would ask but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father . she even wept over the idea of it as a sin of thought . while he lived it must be only an engagement but she flattered herself that if divested of the danger of drawing her away it might become an increase of comfort to him . how to do her best by harriet was of more difficult decision how to spare her from any unnecessary pain how to make her any possible atonement how to appear least her enemy on these subjects her perplexity and distress were very great and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it . she could only resolve at last that she would still avoid a meeting with her and communicate all that need be told by letter that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from highbury andindulging in one scheme more nearly resolve that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to brunswick square . isabella had been pleased with harriet and a few weeks spent in london must give her some amusement . she did not think it in harriets nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety by the streets the shops and the children . at any rate it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself from whom every thing was due a separation for the present an averting of the evil day when they must all be together again . she rose early and wrote her letter to harriet an employment which left her so very serious so nearly sad that mr .  knightley in walking up to hartfield to breakfast did not arrive at all too soon and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him literally and figuratively was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before . he had not left her long by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else when a letter was brought her from randallsa very thick lettershe guessed what it must contain and deprecated the necessity of reading it . she was now in perfect charity with frank churchill she wanted no explanations she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself and as for understanding any thing he wrote she was sure she was incapable of it . it must be waded through however . she opened the packet it was too surely soa note from mrs .  weston to herself ushered in the letter from frank to mrs .  weston . i have the greatest pleasure my dear emma in forwarding to you the enclosed . i know what thorough justice you will do it and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect . i think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again but i will not delay you by a long preface . we are quite well . this letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness i have been feeling lately . i did not quite like your looks on tuesday but it was an ungenial morning and though you will never own being affected by weather i think every body feels a northeast wind . i felt for your dear father very much in the storm of tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning but had the comfort of hearing last night by mr .  perry that it had not made him ill .  yours ever a .  w .  to mrs .  weston . windsorjuly . my dear madam if i made myself intelligible yesterday this letter will be expected but expected or not i know it will be read with candour and indulgence . you are all goodness and i believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct . but i have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent . my courage rises while i write . it is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble . i have already met with such success in two applications for pardon that i may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence . you must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when i first arrived at randalls you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards . this was the fact . my right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment is another question . i shall not discuss it here . for my temptation to think it a right i refer every caviller to a brick house sashed windows below and casements above in highbury . i dared not address her openly my difficulties in the then state of enscombe must be too well known to require definition and i was fortunate enough to prevail before we parted at weymouth and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement . had she refused i should have gone mad . but you will be ready to say what was your hope in doing thiswhat did you look forward to to any thing every thingto time chance circumstance slow effects sudden bursts perseverance and weariness health and sickness . every possibility of good was before me and the first of blessings secured in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence . if you need farther explanation i have the honour my dear madam of being your husbands son and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of . see me then under these circumstances arriving on my first visit to randallsand here i am conscious of wrong for that visit might have been sooner paid . you will look back and see that i did not come till miss fairfax was in highbury and as you were the person slighted you will forgive me instantly but i must work on my fathers compassion by reminding him that so long as i absented myself from his house so long i lost the blessing of knowing you . my behaviour during the very happy fortnight which i spent with you did not i hope lay me open to reprehension excepting on one point . and now i come to the principal the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you which excites my own anxiety or requires very solicitous explanation . with the greatest respect and the warmest friendship do i mention miss woodhouse my father perhaps will think i ought to add with the deepest humiliation . a few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion and some censure i acknowledge myself liable to . my behaviour to miss woodhouse indicated i believe more than it ought . in order to assist a concealment so essential to me i was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown . i cannot deny that miss woodhouse was my ostensible objectbut i am sure you will believe the declaration that had i not been convinced of her indifference i would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on . amiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me was as much my conviction as my wish . she received my attentions with an easy friendly goodhumoured playfulness which exactly suited me . we seemed to understand each other . from our relative situation those attentions were her due and were felt to be so . whether miss woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight i cannot saywhen i called to take leave of her i remember that i was within a moment of confessing the truth and i then fancied she was not without suspicion but i have no doubt of her having since detected me at least in some degree . she may not have surmised the whole but her quickness must have penetrated a part . i cannot doubt it . you will find whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints that it did not take her wholly by surprize . she frequently gave me hints of it . i remember her telling me at the ball that i owed mrs .  elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfax . i hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss . while you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhouse i could deserve nothing from either . acquit me here and procure for me when it is allowable the acquittal and good wishes of that said emma woodhouse whom i regard with so much brotherly affection as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself . whatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight you have now a key to . my heart was in highbury and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be and with the least suspicion . if you remember any queernesses set them all to the right account . of the pianoforte so much talked of i feel it only necessary to say that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f who would never have allowed me to send it had any choice been given her . the delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement my dear madam is much beyond my power of doing justice to . you will soon i earnestly hope know her thoroughly yourself . no description can describe her . she must tell you herself what she is yet not by word for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit . since i began this letter which will be longer than i foresaw i have heard from her . she gives a good account of her own health but as she never complains i dare not depend . i want to have your opinion of her looks . i know you will soon call on her she is living in dread of the visit . perhaps it is paid already . let me hear from you without delay i am impatient for a thousand particulars . remember how few minutes i was at randalls and in how bewildered how mad a state and i am not much better yet still insane either from happiness or misery . when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with of her excellence and patience and my uncles generosity i am mad with joy but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her and how little i deserve to be forgiven i am mad with anger . if i could but see her againbut i must not propose it yet . my uncle has been too good for me to encroach . i must still add to this long letter . you have not heard all that you ought to hear . i could not give any connected detail yesterday but the suddenness and in one light the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out needs explanation for though the event of the 26th ult . as you will conclude immediately opened to me the happiest prospects i should not have presumed on such early measures but from the very particular circumstances which left me not an hour to lose . i should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement . but i had no choice . the hasty engagement she had entered into with that womanhere my dear madam i was obliged to leave off abruptly to recollect and compose myself . i have been walking over the country and am now i hope rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be . it is in fact a most mortifying retrospect for me . i behaved shamefully . and here i can admit that my manners to miss w .  in being unpleasant to miss f .  were highly blameable . she disapproved them which ought to have been enough . my plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient . she was displeased i thought unreasonably so i thought her on a thousand occasions unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious i thought her even cold . but she was always right . if i had followed her judgment and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper i should have escaped the greatest unhappiness i have ever known . we quarrelled . do you remember the morning spent at donwellthere every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis . i was late i met her walking home by herself and wanted to walk with her but she would not suffer it . she absolutely refused to allow me which i then thought most unreasonable . now however i see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion . while i to blind the world to our engagement was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution uselesshad we been met walking together between donwell and highbury the truth must have been suspected . i was mad enough however to resent . i doubted her affection . i doubted it more the next day on box hill when provoked by such conduct on my side such shameful insolent neglect of her and such apparent devotion to miss w .  as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me . in short my dear madam it was a quarrel blameless on her side abominable on mine and i returned the same evening to richmond though i might have staid with you till the next morning merely because i would be as angry with her as possible . even then i was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time but i was the injured person injured by her coldness and i went away determined that she should make the first advances . i shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party . had you witnessed my behaviour there i can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again . its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced as soon as she found i was really gone from randalls she closed with the offer of that officious mrs .  elton the whole system of whose treatment of her by the bye has ever filled me with indignation and hatred . i must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself but otherwise i should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known . jane indeedyou will observe that i have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name even to you . think then what i must have endured in hearing it bandied between the eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition and all the insolence of imaginary superiority . have patience with me i shall soon have done . she closed with this offer resolving to break with me entirely and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again . she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each she dissolved it . this letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunts death . i answered it within an hour but from the confusion of my mind and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once my answer instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day was locked up in my writingdesk and i trusting that i had written enough though but a few lines to satisfy her remained without any uneasiness . i was rather disappointed that i did not hear from her again speedily but i made excuses for her and was too busy andmay i add too cheerful in my views to be captious . we removed to windsor and two days afterwards i received a parcel from her my own letters all returnedand a few lines at the same time by the post stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last and adding that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible she now sent me by a safe conveyance all my letters and requested that if i could not directly command hers so as to send them to highbury within a week i would forward them after that period to her at in short the full direction to mr .  smallridges near bristol stared me in the face . i knew the name the place i knew all about it and instantly saw what she had been doing . it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which i knew her to possess and the secrecy she had maintained as to any such design in her former letter was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy . for the world would not she have seemed to threaten me . imagine the shock imagine how till i had actually detected my own blunder i raved at the blunders of the post . what was to be doneone thing only . i must speak to my uncle . without his sanction i could not hope to be listened to again . i spoke circumstances were in my favour the late event had softened away his pride and he was earlier than i could have anticipated wholly reconciled and complying and could say at last poor man with a deep sigh that he wished i might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done . i felt that it would be of a different sort . are you disposed to pity me for what i must have suffered in opening the cause to him for my suspense while all was at stakeno do not pity me till i reached highbury and saw how ill i had made her . do not pity me till i saw her wan sick looks . i reached highbury at the time of day when from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour i was certain of a good chance of finding her alone . i was not disappointed and at last i was not disappointed either in the object of my journey . a great deal of very reasonable very just displeasure i had to persuade away . but it is done we are reconciled dearer much dearer than ever and no moments uneasiness can ever occur between us again . now my dear madam i will release you but i could not conclude before . a thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her . if you think me in a way to be happier than i deserve i am quite of your opinion . miss w .  calls me the child of good fortune . i hope she is right . in one respect my good fortune is undoubted that of being able to subscribe myself your obliged and affectionate son f .  c .  weston churchill . chapter xv this letter must make its way to emmas feelings . she was obliged in spite of her previous determination to the contrary to do it all the justice that mrs .  weston foretold . as soon as she came to her own name it was irresistible every line relating to herself was interesting and almost every line agreeable and when this charm ceased the subject could still maintain itself by the natural return of her former regard for the writer and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment . she never stopt till she had gone through the whole and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong yet he had been less wrong than she had supposedand he had suffered and was very sorryand he was so grateful to mrs .  weston and so much in love with miss fairfax and she was so happy herself that there was no being severe and could he have entered the room she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever . she thought so well of the letter that when mr .  knightley came again she desired him to read it . she was sure of mrs .  westons wishing it to be communicated especially to one who like mr .  knightley had seen so much to blame in his conduct . i shall be very glad to look it over said he but it seems long . i will take it home with me at night . but that would not do . mr .  weston was to call in the evening and she must return it by him . i would rather be talking to you he replied but as it seems a matter of justice it shall be done . he beganstopping however almost directly to say had i been offered the sight of one of this gentlemans letters to his motherinlaw a few months ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference . he proceeded a little farther reading to himself and then with a smile observed humph a fine complimentary opening but it is his way . one mans style must not be the rule of anothers . we will not be severe . it will be natural for me he added shortly afterwards to speak my opinion aloud as i read . by doing it i shall feel that i am near you . it will not be so great a loss of time but if you dislike it not at all . i should wish it . mr .  knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity . he trifles here said he as to the temptation . he knows he is wrong and has nothing rational to urge . bad . he ought not to have formed the engagement . his fathers disposition he is unjust however to his father . mr .  westons sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions but mr .  weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it . very true he did not come till miss fairfax was here . and i have not forgotten said emma how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would . you pass it over very handsomely but you were perfectly right . i was not quite impartial in my judgment emmabut yet i think had you not been in the casei should still have distrusted him . when he came to miss woodhouse he was obliged to read the whole of it aloudall that related to her with a smile a look a shake of the head a word or two of assent or disapprobation or merely of love as the subject required concluding however seriously and after steady reflection thus very badthough it might have been worse . playing a most dangerous game . too much indebted to the event for his acquittal . no judge of his own manners by you . always deceived in fact by his own wishes and regardless of little besides his own convenience . fancying you to have fathomed his secret . natural enough his own mind full of intrigue that he should suspect it in others . mystery finessehow they pervert the understanding my emma does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other emma agreed to it and with a blush of sensibility on harriets account which she could not give any sincere explanation of . you had better go on said she . he did so but very soon stopt again to say the pianoforte ah that was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure . a boyish scheme indeedi cannot comprehend a mans wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with and he did know that she would have prevented the instruments coming if she could . after this he made some progress without any pause . frank churchills confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing . i perfectly agree with you sirwas then his remark . you did behave very shamefully . you never wrote a truer line . and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement and his persisting to act in direct opposition to jane fairfaxs sense of right he made a fuller pause to say this is very bad . he had induced her to place herself for his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily . she must have had much more to contend with in carrying on the correspondence than he could . he should have respected even unreasonable scruples had there been such but hers were all reasonable . we must look to her one fault and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment . emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party and grew uncomfortable . her own behaviour had been so very improper she was deeply ashamed and a little afraid of his next look . it was all read however steadily attentively and without the smallest remark and excepting one momentary glance at her instantly withdrawn in the fear of giving painno remembrance of box hill seemed to exist . there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends the eltons was his next observation . his feelings are natural . what actually resolve to break with him entirelyshe felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each she dissolved it . what a view this gives of her sense of his behaviourwell he must be a most extraordinary nay nay read on . you will find how very much he suffers . i hope he does replied mr .  knightley coolly and resuming the letter . smallridgewhat does this mean what is all this she had engaged to go as governess to mrs .  smallridges children a dear friend of mrs .  eltonsa neighbour of maple grove and by the bye i wonder how mrs .  elton bears the disappointment say nothing my dear emma while you oblige me to readnot even of mrs .  elton . only one page more . i shall soon have done . what a letter the man writes i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him . well there is feeling here . he does seem to have suffered in finding her ill . certainly i can have no doubt of his being fond of her . dearer much dearer than ever . i hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation . he is a very liberal thanker with his thousands and tens of thousands . happier than i deserve . come he knows himself there . miss woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune . those were miss woodhouses words were they and a fine endingand there is the letter . the child of good fortune that was your name for him was it you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am but still you must at least i hope you must think the better of him for it . i hope it does him some service with you . yes certainly it does . he has had great faults faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness and i am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves but still as he is beyond a doubt really attached to miss fairfax and will soon it may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly with her i am very ready to believe his character will improve and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants . and now let me talk to you of something else . i have another persons interest at present so much at heart that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill . ever since i left you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work on one subject . the subject followed it was in plain unaffected gentlemanlike english such as mr .  knightley used even to the woman he was in love with how to be able to ask her to marry him without attacking the happiness of her father . emmas answer was ready at the first word . while her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible for her . she could never quit him . part only of this answer however was admitted . the impossibility of her quitting her father mr .  knightley felt as strongly as herself but the inadmissibility of any other change he could not agree to . he had been thinking it over most deeply most intently he had at first hoped to induce mr .  woodhouse to remove with her to donwell he had wanted to believe it feasible but his knowledge of mr .  woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long and now he confessed his persuasion that such a transplantation would be a risk of her fathers comfort perhaps even of his life which must not be hazarded . mr .  woodhouse taken from hartfieldno he felt that it ought not to be attempted . but the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this he trusted his dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable it was that he should be received at hartfield that so long as her fathers happiness in other words his liferequired hartfield to continue her home it should be his likewise . of their all removing to donwell emma had already had her own passing thoughts . like him she had tried the scheme and rejected it but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her . she was sensible of all the affection it evinced . she felt that in quitting donwell he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits that in living constantly with her father and in no house of his own there would be much very much to be borne with . she promised to think of it and advised him to think of it more but he was fully convinced that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject . he had given it he could assure her very long and calm consideration he had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning to have his thoughts to himself . ah there is one difficulty unprovided for cried emma . i am sure william larkins will not like it . you must get his consent before you ask mine . she promised however to think of it and pretty nearly promised moreover to think of it with the intention of finding it a very good scheme . it is remarkable that emma in the many very many points of view in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry whose rights as heirexpectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded . think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of mr .  knightleys marrying jane fairfax or any body else which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt . this proposal of his this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfield the more she contemplated it the more pleasing it became . his evils seemed to lessen her own advantages to increase their mutual good to outweigh every drawback . such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy she would have been too happy but for poor harriet but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend who must now be even excluded from hartfield . the delightful family party which emma was securing for herself poor harriet must in mere charitable caution be kept at a distance from . she would be a loser in every way . emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment . in such a party harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise but for the poor girl herself it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment . in time of course mr .  knightley would be forgotten that is supplanted but this could not be expected to happen very early . mr .  knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure not like mr .  elton . mr .  knightley always so kind so feeling so truly considerate for every body would never deserve to be less worshipped than now and it really was too much to hope even of harriet that she could be in love with more than three men in one year . chapter xvi it was a very great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting . their intercourse was painful enough by letter . how much worse had they been obliged to meet harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed without reproaches or apparent sense of illusage and yet emma fancied there was a something of resentment a something bordering on it in her style which increased the desirableness of their being separate . it might be only her own consciousness but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke . she had no difficulty in procuring isabellas invitation and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it without resorting to invention . there was a tooth amiss . harriet really wished and had wished some time to consult a dentist . mrs .  john knightley was delighted to be of use any thing of ill health was a recommendation to herand though not so fond of a dentist as of a mr .  wingfield she was quite eager to have harriet under her care . when it was thus settled on her sisters side emma proposed it to her friend and found her very persuadable . harriet was to go she was invited for at least a fortnight she was to be conveyed in mr .  woodhouses carriage . it was all arranged it was all completed and harriet was safe in brunswick square . now emma could indeed enjoy mr .  knightleys visits now she could talk and she could listen with true happiness unchecked by that sense of injustice of guilt of something most painful which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her how much might at that moment and at a little distance be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself . the difference of harriet at mrs .  goddards or in london made perhaps an unreasonable difference in emmas sensations but she could not think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment which must be averting the past and carrying her out of herself . she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which harriet had occupied . there was a communication before her one which she only could be competent to make the confession of her engagement to her father but she would have nothing to do with it at present . she had resolved to defer the disclosure till mrs .  weston were safe and well . no additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time . a fortnight at least of leisure and peace of mind to crown every warmer but more agitating delight should be hers . she soon resolved equally as a duty and a pleasure to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax . she ought to goand she was longing to see her the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill . it would be a secret satisfaction but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing jane might communicate . she wentshe had driven once unsuccessfully to the door but had not been into the house since the morning after box hill when poor jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected . the fear of being still unwelcome determined her though assured of their being at home to wait in the passage and send up her name . she heard patty announcing it but no such bustle succeeded as poor miss bates had before made so happily intelligible . no she heard nothing but the instant reply of beg her to walk upand a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself coming eagerly forward as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient . emma had never seen her look so well so lovely so engaging . there was consciousness animation and warmth there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted . she came forward with an offered hand and said in a low but very feeling tone this is most kind indeedmiss woodhouse it is impossible for me to expressi hope you will believeexcuse me for being so entirely without words . emma was gratified and would soon have shewn no want of words if the sound of mrs .  eltons voice from the sittingroom had not checked her and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very very earnest shake of the hand . mrs .  bates and mrs .  elton were together . miss bates was out which accounted for the previous tranquillity . emma could have wished mrs .  elton elsewhere but she was in a humour to have patience with every body and as mrs .  elton met her with unusual graciousness she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm . she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs .  eltons thoughts and understand why she was like herself in happy spirits it was being in miss fairfaxs confidence and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people . emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face and while paying her own compliments to mrs .  bates and appearing to attend to the good old ladys replies she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side saying with significant nods we can finish this some other time you know . you and i shall not want opportunities . and in fact you have heard all the essential already . i only wanted to prove to you that mrs .  s .  admits our apology and is not offended . you see how delightfully she writes . oh she is a sweet creature you would have doated on her had you gone . but not a word more . let us be discreet quite on our good behaviour . hushyou remember those lines i forget the poem at this moment for when a ladys in the case you know all other things give place . now i say my dear in our case for lady readmum a word to the wise . i am in a fine flow of spirits ant i but i want to set your heart at ease as to mrs .  s . my representation you see has quite appeased her . and again on emmas merely turning her head to look at mrs .  batess knitting she added in a half whisper i mentioned no names you will observe . oh no cautious as a minister of state . i managed it extremely well . emma could not doubt . it was a palpable display repeated on every possible occasion . when they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and mrs .  weston she found herself abruptly addressed with do not you think miss woodhouse our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovereddo not you think her cure does perry the highest credithere was a sideglance of great meaning at jane . upon my word perry has restored her in a wonderful short time oh if you had seen her as i did when she was at the worst and when mrs .  bates was saying something to emma whispered farther we do not say a word of any assistance that perry might have not a word of a certain young physician from windsor . oh no perry shall have all the credit . i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you miss woodhouse she shortly afterwards began since the party to box hill . very pleasant party . but yet i think there was something wanting . things did not seemthat is there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some . so it appeared to me at least but i might be mistaken . however i think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again . what say you both to our collecting the same party and exploring to box hill again while the fine weather lasts it must be the same party you know quite the same party not one exception . soon after this miss bates came in and emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself resulting she supposed from doubt of what might be said and impatience to say every thing . thank you dear miss woodhouse you are all kindness . it is impossible to sayyes indeed i quite understanddearest janes prospects that is i do not mean . but she is charmingly recovered . how is mr .  woodhousei am so glad . quite out of my power . such a happy little circle as you find us here . yes indeed . charming young manthat isso very friendly i mean good mr .  perry such attention to janeand from her great her more than commonly thankful delight towards mrs .  elton for being there emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards jane from the vicarage quarter which was now graciously overcome . after a few whispers indeed which placed it beyond a guess mrs .  elton speaking louder said yes here i am my good friend and here i have been so long that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise but the truth is that i am waiting for my lord and master . he promised to join me here and pay his respects to you . what are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr .  elton that will be a favour indeed for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits and mr .  eltons time is so engaged . upon my word it is miss bates . he really is engaged from morning to night . there is no end of peoples coming to him on some pretence or other . the magistrates and overseers and churchwardens are always wanting his opinion . they seem not able to do any thing without him . upon my word mr .  e .  i often say rather you than i .  i do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument if i had half so many applicants . bad enough as it is for i absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree . i believe i have not played a bar this fortnight . however he is coming i assure you yes indeed on purpose to wait on you all . and putting up her hand to screen her words from emmaa congratulatory visit you know . oh yes quite indispensable . miss bates looked about her so happily he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from knightley but he and knightley are shut up together in deep consultation . mr . e .  is knightleys right hand . emma would not have smiled for the world and only said is mr .  elton gone on foot to donwellhe will have a hot walk . oh no it is a meeting at the crown a regular meeting . weston and cole will be there too but one is apt to speak only of those who lead . i fancy mr .  e .  and knightley have every thing their own way . have not you mistaken the day said emma . i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till tomorrow . mr . knightley was at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday . oh no the meeting is certainly today was the abrupt answer which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mrs .  eltons side . i do believe she continued this is the most troublesome parish that ever was . we never heard of such things at maple grove . your parish there was small said jane . upon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject talked of . but it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and mrs .  bragge the only school and not more than fiveandtwenty children . ah you clever creature thats very true . what a thinking brain you have i say jane what a perfect character you and i should make if we could be shaken together . my liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection . not that i presume to insinuate however that some people may not think you perfection already . but hush not a word if you please . it seemed an unnecessary caution jane was wanting to give her words not to mrs .  elton but to miss woodhouse as the latter plainly saw . the wish of distinguishing her as far as civility permitted was very evident though it could not often proceed beyond a look . mr .  elton made his appearance . his lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity . very pretty sir upon my word to send me on here to be an encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with . you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared . here have i been sitting this hour giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obediencefor who can say you know how soon it may be wanted mr .  elton was so hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away . his civilities to the other ladies must be paid but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering and the walk he had had for nothing . when i got to donwell said he knightley could not be found . very odd very unaccountable after the note i sent him this morning and the message he returned that he should certainly be at home till one . donwell cried his wife . my dear mr .  e .  you have not been to donwellyou mean the crown you come from the meeting at the crown . no no thats tomorrow and i particularly wanted to see knightley today on that very account . such a dreadful broiling morning i went over the fields toospeaking in a tone of great illusage which made it so much the worse . and then not to find him at home i assure you i am not at all pleased . and no apology left no message for me . the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected . very extraordinaryand nobody knew at all which way he was gone . perhaps to hartfield perhaps to the abbey mill perhaps into his woods . miss woodhouse this is not like our friend knightleycan you explain it emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary indeed and that she had not a syllable to say for him . i cannot imagine said mrs .  elton feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you of all people in the world the very last person whom one should expect to be forgottenmy dear mr .  e .  he must have left a message for you i am sure he must . not even knightley could be so very eccentric and his servants forgot it . depend upon it that was the case and very likely to happen with the donwell servants who are all i have often observed extremely awkward and remiss . i am sure i would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration . and as for mrs .  hodges wright holds her very cheap indeed . she promised wright a receipt and never sent it . i met william larkins continued mr .  elton as i got near the house and he told me i should not find his master at home but i did not believe him . william seemed rather out of humour . he did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the speech of him . i have nothing to do with williams wants but it really is of very great importance that i should see knightley today and it becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk to no purpose . emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly . in all probability she was at this very time waited for there and mr .  knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards mr .  elton if not towards william larkins . she was pleased on taking leave to find miss fairfax determined to attend her out of the room to go with her even downstairs it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of to say it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility . had you not been surrounded by other friends i might have been tempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct . i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent . oh cried jane with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composurethere would have been no danger . the danger would have been of my wearying you . you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest . indeed miss woodhouse speaking more collectedly with the consciousness which i have of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good opinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to such a degree as toi have not time for half that i could wish to say . i long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself . i feel it so very due . but unfortunatelyin short if your compassion does not stand my friend oh you are too scrupulous indeed you are cried emma warmly and taking her hand . you owe me no apologies and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them is so perfectly satisfied so delighted even you are very kind but i know what my manners were to you . so cold and artificiali had always a part to act . it was a life of deceiti know that i must have disgusted you . pray say no more . i feel that all the apologies should be on my side . let us forgive each other at once . we must do whatever is to be done quickest and i think our feelings will lose no time there . i hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor very . and the next news i suppose will be that we are to lose you just as i begin to know you . oh as to all that of course nothing can be thought of yet . i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs .  campbell . nothing can be actually settled yet perhaps replied emma smilingbut excuse me it must be thought of . the smile was returned as jane answered you are very right it has been thought of . and i will own to you i am sure it will be safe that so far as our living with mr .  churchill at enscombe it is settled . there must be three months at least of deep mourning but when they are over i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for . thank you thank you . this is just what i wanted to be assured of . oh if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open goodbye goodbye . chapter xvii mrs .  westons friends were all made happy by her safety and if the satisfaction of her welldoing could be increased to emma it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl . she had been decided in wishing for a miss weston . she would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her hereafter with either of isabellas sons but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best . it would be a great comfort to mr .  weston as he grew older and even mr .  weston might be growing older ten years henceto have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home and mrs .  weston no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach should not have their powers in exercise again . she has had the advantage you know of practising on me she continuedlike la baronne dalmane on la comtesse dostalis in madame de genlis adelaide and theodore and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan . that is replied mr .  knightley she will indulge her even more than she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all . it will be the only difference . poor child cried emma at that rate what will become of her nothing very bad . the fate of thousands . she will be disagreeable in infancy and correct herself as she grows older . i am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children my dearest emma . i who am owing all my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them emma laughed and replied but i had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people . i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it . do youi have no doubt . nature gave you understanding miss taylor gave you principles . you must have done well . my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good . it was very natural for you to say what right has he to lecture me and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner . i do not believe i did you any good . the good was all to myself by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me . i could not think about you so much without doating on you faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least . i am sure you were of use to me cried emma . i was very often influenced rightly by youoftener than i would own at the time . i am very sure you did me good . and if poor little anna weston is to be spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me except falling in love with her when she is thirteen . how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your saucy looksmr . knightley i am going to do soandso papa says i may or i have miss taylors leavesomething which you knew i did not approve . in such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one . what an amiable creature i wasno wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance . mr .  knightley . you always called me mr .  knightley and from habit it has not so very formal a sound . and yet it is formal . i want you to call me something else but i do not know what . i remember once calling you george in one of my amiable fits about ten years ago . i did it because i thought it would offend you but as you made no objection i never did it again . and cannot you call me george now impossiblei never can call you any thing but mr .  knightley . i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs .  elton by calling you mr .  k . but i will promise she added presently laughing and blushingi will promise to call you once by your christian name . i do not say when but perhaps you may guess wherein the building in which n .  takes m .  for better for worse . emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly folliesher wilful intimacy with harriet smith but it was too tender a subject . she could not enter on it . harriet was very seldom mentioned between them . this on his side might merely proceed from her not being thought of but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy and a suspicion from some appearances that their friendship were declining . she was aware herself that parting under any other circumstances they certainly should have corresponded more and that her intelligence would not have rested as it now almost wholly did on isabellas letters . he might observe that it was so . the pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him was very little inferior to the pain of having made harriet unhappy . isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits which appeared perfectly natural as there was a dentist to be consulted but since that business had been over she did not appear to find harriet different from what she had known her before . isabella to be sure was no very quick observer yet if harriet had not been equal to playing with the children it would not have escaped her . emmas comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on by harriets being to stay longer her fortnight was likely to be a month at least . mr .  and mrs .  john knightley were to come down in august and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back . john does not even mention your friend said mr .  knightley . here is his answer if you like to see it . it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage . emma accepted it with a very eager hand with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned . john enters like a brother into my happiness continued mr .  knightley but he is no complimenter and though i well know him to have likewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from making flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise . but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes . he writes like a sensible man replied emma when she had read the letter . i honour his sincerity . it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as you think me already . had he said any thing to bear a different construction i should not have believed him . my emma he means no such thing . he only means he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two interrupted she with a sort of serious smilemuch less perhaps than he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject . emma my dear emma oh she cried with more thorough gaiety if you fancy your brother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret and hear his opinion . depend upon it he will be much farther from doing you justice . he will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question all the merit on mine . i wish i may not sink into poor emma with him at once . his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther . ah he cried i wish your father might be half as easily convinced as john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give to be happy together . i am amused by one part of johns letter did you notice itwhere he says that my information did not take him wholly by surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind . if i understand your brother he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying . he had no idea of me . he seems perfectly unprepared for that . yes yesbut i am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings . what has he been judging byi am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another . but it was so i suppose . i dare say there was a difference when i was staying with them the other day . i believe i did not play with the children quite so much as usual . i remember one evening the poor boys saying uncle seems always tired now . the time was coming when the news must spread farther and other persons reception of it tried . as soon as mrs .  weston was sufficiently recovered to admit mr .  woodhouses visits emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause resolved first to announce it at home and then at randalls . but how to break it to her father at lastshe had bound herself to do it in such an hour of mr .  knightleys absence or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her and she must have put it off but mr .  knightley was to come at such a time and follow up the beginning she was to make . she was forced to speak and to speak cheerfully too . she must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him by a melancholy tone herself . she must not appear to think it a misfortune . with all the spirits she could command she prepared him first for something strange and then in a few words said that if his consent and approbation could be obtainedwhich she trusted would be attended with no difficulty since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all she and mr .  knightley meant to marry by which means hartfield would receive the constant addition of that persons company whom she knew he loved next to his daughters and mrs .  weston best in the world . poor manit was at first a considerable shock to him and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it . she was reminded more than once of having always said she would never marry and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single and told of poor isabella and poor miss taylor . but it would not do . emma hung about him affectionately and smiled and said it must be so and that he must not class her with isabella and mrs .  weston whose marriages taking them from hartfield had indeed made a melancholy change but she was not going from hartfield she should be always there she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having mr .  knightley always at hand when he were once got used to the idea . did he not love mr .  knightley very much he would not deny that he did she was sure . whom did he ever want to consult on business but mr .  knightleywho was so useful to him who so ready to write his letters who so glad to assist him who so cheerful so attentive so attached to himwould not he like to have him always on the spotyes . that was all very true . mr .  knightley could not be there too often he should be glad to see him every daybut they did see him every day as it was . why could not they go on as they had done mr .  woodhouse could not be soon reconciled but the worst was overcome the idea was given time and continual repetition must do the rest . to emmas entreaties and assurances succeeded mr .  knightleys whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome and he was soon used to be talked to by each on every fair occasion . they had all the assistance which isabella could give by letters of the strongest approbation and mrs .  weston was ready on the first meeting to consider the subject in the most serviceable lightfirst as a settled and secondly as a good one well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to mr .  woodhouses mind . it was agreed upon as what was to be and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it he began to think that some time or other in another year or two perhapsit might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place . mrs .  weston was acting no part feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event . she had been extremely surprized never more so than when emma first opened the affair to her but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost . she had such a regard for mr .  knightley as to think he deserved even her dearest emma and it was in every respect so proper suitable and unexceptionable a connexion and in one respect one point of the highest importance so peculiarly eligible so singularly fortunate that now it seemed as if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it and wished it long ago . how very few of those men in a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own home for hartfield and who but mr .  knightley could know and bear with mr .  woodhouse so as to make such an arrangement desirable the difficulty of disposing of poor mr .  woodhouse had been always felt in her husbands plans and her own for a marriage between frank and emma . how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had been a continual impedimentless acknowledged by mr .  weston than by herselfbut even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by sayingthose matters will take care of themselves the young people will find a way . but here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future . it was all right all open all equal . no sacrifice on any side worth the name . it was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself and without one real rational difficulty to oppose or delay it . mrs .  weston with her baby on her knee indulging in such reflections as these was one of the happiest women in the world . if any thing could increase her delight it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps . the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread and mr .  weston had his five minutes share of it but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind . he saw the advantages of the match and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife but the wonder of it was very soon nothing and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it . it is to be a secret i conclude said he . these matters are always a secret till it is found out that every body knows them . only let me be told when i may speak out . i wonder whether jane has any suspicion . he went to highbury the next morning and satisfied himself on that point . he told her the news . was not she like a daughter his eldest daughterhe must tell her and miss bates being present it passed of course to mrs .  cole mrs .  perry and mrs .  elton immediately afterwards . it was no more than the principals were prepared for they had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls how soon it would be over highbury and were thinking of themselves as the evening wonder in many a family circle with great sagacity . in general it was a very well approved match . some might think him and others might think her the most in luck . one set might recommend their all removing to donwell and leaving hartfield for the john knightleys and another might predict disagreements among their servants but yet upon the whole there was no serious objection raised except in one habitation the vicarage . there the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction . mr .  elton cared little about it compared with his wife he only hoped the young ladys pride would now be contented and supposed she had always meant to catch knightley if she could and on the point of living at hartfield could daringly exclaim rather he than i but mrs .  elton was very much discomposed indeed . poor knightley poor fellowsad business for him . she was extremely concerned for though very eccentric he had a thousand good qualities . how could he be so taken indid not think him at all in love not in the least . poor knightleythere would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him . how happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him but that would be all over now . poor fellowno more exploring parties to donwell made for her . oh no there would be a mrs .  knightley to throw cold water on every thing . extremely disagreeable but she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day . shocking plan living together . it would never do . she knew a family near maple grove who had tried it and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter . chapter xviii time passed on . a few more tomorrows and the party from london would be arriving . it was an alarming change and emma was thinking of it one morning as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her when mr .  knightley came in and distressing thoughts were put by . after the first chat of pleasure he was silent and then in a graver tone began with i have something to tell you emma some news . good or bad said she quickly looking up in his face . i do not know which it ought to be called . oh good i am sure . i see it in your countenance . you are trying not to smile . i am afraid said he composing his features i am very much afraid my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it . indeed but why soi can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too . there is one subject he replied i hope but one on which we do not think alike . he paused a moment again smiling with his eyes fixed on her face . does nothing occur to you do not you recollectharriet smith . her cheeks flushed at the name and she felt afraid of something though she knew not what . have you heard from her yourself this morning cried he . you have i believe and know the whole . no i have not i know nothing pray tell me . you are prepared for the worst i seeand very bad it is . harriet smith marries robert martin . emma gave a start which did not seem like being prepared and her eyes in eager gaze said no this is impossible but her lips were closed . it is so indeed continued mr .  knightley i have it from robert martin himself . he left me not half an hour ago . she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement . you like it my emma as little as i feared . i wish our opinions were the same . but in time they will . time you may be sure will make one or the other of us think differently and in the meanwhile we need not talk much on the subject . you mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself . it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy but i cannot believe it . it seems an impossibilityyou cannot mean to say that harriet smith has accepted robert martin . you cannot mean that he has even proposed to her againyet . you only mean that he intends it . i mean that he has done it answered mr .  knightley with smiling but determined decision and been accepted . good god she cried . wellthen having recourse to her workbasket in excuse for leaning down her face and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing she added well now tell me every thing make this intelligible to me . how where whenlet me know it all . i never was more surprizedbut it does not make me unhappy i assure you . howhow has it been possible it is a very simple story . he went to town on business three days ago and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send to john . he delivered these papers to john at his chambers and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astleys . they were going to take the two eldest boys to astleys . the party was to be our brother and sister henry johnand miss smith . my friend robert could not resist . they called for him in their way were all extremely amused and my brother asked him to dine with them the next daywhich he didand in the course of that visit as i understand he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet and certainly did not speak in vain . she made him by her acceptance as happy even as he is deserving . he came down by yesterdays coach and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own . this is all that i can relate of the how where and when . your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her . she will give you all the minute particulars which only womans language can make interesting . in our communications we deal only in the great . however i must say that robert martins heart seemed for him and to me very overflowing and that he did mention without its being much to the purpose that on quitting their box at astleys my brother took charge of mrs .  john knightley and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith rather uneasy . he stopped . emma dared not attempt any immediate reply . to speak she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness . she must wait a moment or he would think her mad . her silence disturbed him and after observing her a little while he added emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected . his situation is an evilbut you must consider it as what satisfies your friend and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more . his good sense and good principles would delight you . as far as the man is concerned you could not wish your friend in better hands . his rank in society i would alter if i could which is saying a great deal i assure you emma . you laugh at me about william larkins but i could quite as ill spare robert martin . he wanted her to look up and smile and having now brought herself not to smile too broadlyshe didcheerfully answering you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match . i think harriet is doing extremely well . her connexions may be worse than his . in respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are . i have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize . you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me how peculiarly unprepared i wasfor i had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him much more than she was before . you ought to know your friend best replied mr .  knightley but i should say she was a goodtempered softhearted girl not likely to be very very determined against any young man who told her he loved her . emma could not help laughing as she answered upon my word i believe you know her quite as well as i do . but mr .  knightley are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him . i could suppose she might in timebut can she already did not you misunderstand himyou were both talking of other things of business shows of cattle or new drillsand might not you in the confusion of so many subjects mistake himit was not harriets hand that he was certain ofit was the dimensions of some famous ox . the contrast between the countenance and air of mr .  knightley and robert martin was at this moment so strong to emmas feelings and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on harriets side so fresh the sound of those words spoken with such emphasis no i hope i know better than to think of robert martin that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove in some measure premature . it could not be otherwise . do you dare say this cried mr .  knightley . do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking of what do you deserve oh i always deserve the best treatment because i never put up with any other and therefore you must give me a plain direct answer . are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which mr .  martin and harriet now are i am quite sure he replied speaking very distinctly that he told me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity nothing doubtful in the words he used and i think i can give you a proof that it must be so . he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do . he knew of no one but mrs .  goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends . could i mention any thing more fit to be done than to go to mrs .  goddard i assured him that i could not . then he said he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day . i am perfectly satisfied replied emma with the brightest smiles and most sincerely wish them happy . you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before . i hope sofor at that time i was a fool . and i am changed also for i am now very willing to grant you all harriets good qualities . i have taken some pains for your sake and for robert martins sake whom i have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her . i have often talked to her a good deal . you must have seen that i did . sometimes indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor martins cause which was never the case but from all my observations i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life . much of this i have no doubt she may thank you for . me cried emma shaking her head . ah poor harriet she checked herself however and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved . their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father . she was not sorry . she wanted to be alone . her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her to be collected . she was in dancing singing exclaiming spirits and till she had moved about and talked to herself and laughed and reflected she could be fit for nothing rational . her fathers business was to announce jamess being gone out to put the horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls and she had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing . the joy the gratitude the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined . the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of harriets welfare she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security . what had she to wish for nothing but to grow more worthy of him whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own . nothing but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future . serious she was very serious in her thankfulness and in her resolutions and yet there was no preventing a laugh sometimes in the very midst of them . she must laugh at such a close such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back such a heartsuch a harriet now there would be pleasure in her returningevery thing would be a pleasure . it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin . high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from mr .  knightley would soon be over . the disguise equivocation mystery so hateful to her to practise might soon be over . she could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty . in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father not always listening but always agreeing to what he said and whether in speech or silence conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day or poor mrs .  weston would be disappointed . they arrived . mrs . weston was alone in the drawingroom but hardly had they been told of the baby and mr .  woodhouse received the thanks for coming which he asked for when a glimpse was caught through the blind of two figures passing near the window . it is frank and miss fairfax said mrs .  weston . i was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning . he stays till tomorrow and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us . they are coming in i hope . in half a minute they were in the room . emma was extremely glad to see himbut there was a degree of confusiona number of embarrassing recollections on each side . they met readily and smiling but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said and having all sat down again there was for some time such a blank in the circle that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged which she had long felt of seeing frank churchill once more and of seeing him with jane would yield its proportion of pleasure . when mr .  weston joined the party however and when the baby was fetched there was no longer a want of subject or animation or of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her and say i have to thank you miss woodhouse for a very kind forgiving message in one of mrs .  westons letters . i hope time has not made you less willing to pardon . i hope you do not retract what you then said . no indeed cried emma most happy to begin not in the least . i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with youand to give you joy in person . he thanked her with all his heart and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness . is not she looking well said he turning his eyes towards jane . better than she ever used to doyou see how my father and mrs .  weston doat upon her . but his spirits were soon rising again and with laughing eyes after mentioning the expected return of the campbells he named the name of dixon . emma blushed and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing . i can never think of it she cried without extreme shame . the shame he answered is all mine or ought to be . but is it possible that you had no suspicioni mean of late . early i know you had none . i never had the smallest i assure you . that appears quite wonderful . i was once very nearand i wish i had it would have been better . but though i was always doing wrong things they were very bad wrong things and such as did me no service . it would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing . it is not now worth a regret said emma . i have some hope resumed he of my uncles being persuaded to pay a visit at randalls he wants to be introduced to her . when the campbells are returned we shall meet them in london and continue there i trust till we may carry her northward . but now i am at such a distance from heris not it hard miss woodhouse till this morning we have not once met since the day of reconciliation . do not you pity me emma spoke her pity so very kindly that with a sudden accession of gay thought he cried ah by the bye then sinking his voice and looking demure for the momenti hope mr .  knightley is well he paused . she coloured and laughed . i know you saw my letter and think you may remember my wish in your favour . let me return your congratulations . i assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction . he is a man whom i cannot presume to praise . emma was delighted and only wanted him to go on in the same style but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own jane and his next words were did you ever see such a skinsuch smoothness such delicacy and yet without being actually fair . one cannot call her fair . it is a most uncommon complexion with her dark eyelashes and hair a most distinguishing complexion so peculiarly the lady in it . just colour enough for beauty . i have always admired her complexion replied emma archly but do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale when we first began to talk of her . have you quite forgotten oh nowhat an impudent dog i washow could i dare but he laughed so heartily at the recollection that emma could not help saying i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you had very great amusement in tricking us all . i am sure you had . i am sure it was a consolation to you . oh no no nohow can you suspect me of such a thing i was the most miserable wretch not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth . i am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking us all in . perhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell you the truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation . i think there is a little likeness between us . he bowed . if not in our dispositions she presently added with a look of true sensibility there is a likeness in our destiny the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own . true true he answered warmly . no not true on your side . you can have no superior but most true on mine . she is a complete angel . look at her . is not she an angel in every gesture observe the turn of her throat . observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father . you will be glad to hear inclining his head and whispering seriously that my uncle means to give her all my aunts jewels . they are to be new set . i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head . will not it be beautiful in her dark hair very beautiful indeed replied emma and she spoke so kindly that he gratefully burst out how delighted i am to see you again and to see you in such excellent looksi would not have missed this meeting for the world . i should certainly have called at hartfield had you failed to come . the others had been talking of the child mrs .  weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under the evening before from the infants appearing not quite well . she believed she had been foolish but it had alarmed her and she had been within half a minute of sending for mr .  perry . perhaps she ought to be ashamed but mr .  weston had been almost as uneasy as herself . in ten minutes however the child had been perfectly well again . this was her history and particularly interesting it was to mr .  woodhouse who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry and only regretted that she had not done it . she should always send for perry if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered were it only for a moment . she could not be too soon alarmed nor send for perry too often . it was a pity perhaps that he had not come last night for though the child seemed well now very well considering it would probably have been better if perry had seen it . frank churchill caught the name . perry said he to emma and trying as he spoke to catch miss fairfaxs eye . my friend mr .  perry what are they saying about mr .  perryhas he been here this morningand how does he travel nowhas he set up his carriage emma soon recollected and understood him and while she joined in the laugh it was evident from janes countenance that she too was really hearing him though trying to seem deaf . such an extraordinary dream of mine he cried . i can never think of it without laughing . she hears us she hears us miss woodhouse . i see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown . look at her . do not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter which sent me the report is passing under her eye that the whole blunder is spread before herthat she can attend to nothing else though pretending to listen to the others jane was forced to smile completely for a moment and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him and said in a conscious low yet steady voice how you can bear such recollections is astonishing to me they will sometimes obtrudebut how you can court them he had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly but emmas feelings were chiefly with jane in the argument and on leaving randalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men she felt that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill and really regarding him as she did with friendship she had never been more sensible of mr .  knightleys high superiority of character . the happiness of this most happy day received its completion in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced . chapter xix if emma had still at intervals an anxious feeling for harriet a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to mr .  knightley and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty . a very few days brought the party from london and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet than she became perfectly satisfiedunaccountable as it was that robert martin had thoroughly supplanted mr .  knightley and was now forming all her views of happiness . harriet was a little distresseddid look a little foolish at first but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly and selfdeceived before her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words and leave her without a care for the past and with the fullest exultation in the present and future for as to her friends approbation emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations . harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at astleys and the dinner the next day she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight . but what did such particulars explain the fact was as emma could now acknowledge that harriet had always liked robert martin and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible . beyond this it must ever be unintelligible to emma . the event however was most joyful and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so . harriets parentage became known . she proved to be the daughter of a tradesman rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers and decent enough to have always wished for concealment . such was the blood of gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for it was likely to be as untainted perhaps as the blood of many a gentleman but what a connexion had she been preparing for mr .  knightleyor for the churchillsor even for mr .  elton the stain of illegitimacy unbleached by nobility or wealth would have been a stain indeed . no objection was raised on the fathers side the young man was treated liberally it was all as it should be and as emma became acquainted with robert martin who was now introduced at hartfield she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend . she had no doubt of harriets happiness with any goodtempered man but with him and in the home he offered there would be the hope of more of security stability and improvement . she would be placed in the midst of those who loved her and who had better sense than herself retired enough for safety and occupied enough for cheerfulness . she would be never led into temptation nor left for it to find her out . she would be respectable and happy and emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a manor if not quite the luckiest to yield only to herself . harriet necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins was less and less at hartfield which was not to be regretted . the intimacy between her and emma must sink their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill and fortunately what ought to be and must be seemed already beginning and in the most gradual natural manner . before the end of september emma attended harriet to church and saw her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction as no remembrances even connected with mr .  elton as he stood before them could impair . perhaps indeed at that time she scarcely saw mr .  elton but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself . robert martin and harriet smith the latest couple engaged of the three were the first to be married . jane fairfax had already quitted highbury and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the campbells . the mr .  churchills were also in town and they were only waiting for november . the intermediate month was the one fixed on as far as they dared by emma and mr .  knightley . they had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield to allow them the fortnights absence in a tour to the seaside which was the plan . john and isabella and every other friend were agreed in approving it . but mr .  woodhousehow was mr .  woodhouse to be induced to consenthe who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event . when first sounded on the subject he was so miserable that they were almost hopeless . a second allusion indeed gave less pain . he began to think it was to be and that he could not prevent it a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation . still however he was not happy . nay he appeared so much otherwise that his daughters courage failed . she could not bear to see him suffering to know him fancying himself neglected and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the mr .  knightleys that when once the event were over his distress would be soon over too she hesitatedshe could not proceed . in this state of suspense they were befriended not by any sudden illumination of mr .  woodhouses mind or any wonderful change of his nervous system but by the operation of the same system in another way . mrs .  westons poultryhouse was robbed one night of all her turkeys evidently by the ingenuity of man . other poultryyards in the neighbourhood also suffered . pilfering was housebreaking to mr .  woodhouses fears . he was very uneasy and but for the sense of his soninlaws protection would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life . the strength resolution and presence of mind of the mr .  knightleys commanded his fullest dependence . while either of them protected him and his hartfield was safe . but mr .  john knightley must be in london again by the end of the first week in november . the result of this distress was that with a much more voluntary cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment she was able to fix her weddingdayand mr .  elton was called on within a month from the marriage of mr .  and mrs .  robert martin to join the hands of mr .  knightley and miss woodhouse . the wedding was very much like other weddings where the parties have no taste for finery or parade and mrs .  elton from the particulars detailed by her husband thought it all extremely shabby and very inferior to her own . very little white satin very few lace veils a most pitiful businessselina would stare when she heard of it . but in spite of these deficiencies the wishes the hopes the confidence the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union . finis chapter 1 sir walter elliot of kellynch hall in somersetshire was a man who for his own amusement never took up any book but the baronetage there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century and there if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history with an interest which never failed . this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened elliot of kellynch hall . walter elliot born march 1 1760 married july 15 1784 elizabeth daughter of james stevenson esq . of south park in the county of gloucester by which lady who died 1800 he has issue elizabeth born june 1 1785 anne born august 9 1787 a stillborn son november 5 1789

words after the date of marys birth married december 16 1810 charles son and heir of charles musgrove esq . of uppercross in the county of somerset and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife . then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family in the usual terms how it had been first settled in cheshire how mentioned in dugdale serving the office of high sheriff representing a borough in three successive parliaments exertions of loyalty and dignity of baronet in the first year of charles ii with all the marys and elizabeths they had married forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages and concluding with the arms and mottoprincipal seat kellynch hall in the county of somerset and sir walters handwriting again in this finale heir presumptive william walter elliot esq . great grandson of the second sir walter . vanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliots character vanity of person and of situation . he had been remarkably handsome in his youth and at fiftyfour was still a very fine man . few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society . he considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy and the sir walter elliot who united these gifts was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion . his good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own . lady elliot had been an excellent woman sensible and amiable whose judgement and conduct if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot had never required indulgence afterwards . she had humoured or softened or concealed his failings and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years and though not the very happiest being in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friends and her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them . three girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited silly father . she had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving woman who had been brought by strong attachment to herself to settle close by her in the village of kellynch and on her kindness and advice lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters . this friend and sir walter did not marry whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance . thirteen years had passed away since lady elliots death and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends and one remained a widower the other a widow . that lady russell of steady age and character and extremely well provided for should have no thought of a second marriage needs no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again than when she does not but sir walters continuing in singleness requires explanation . be it known then that sir walter like a good father having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters sake . for one daughter his eldest he would really have given up any thing which he had not been very much tempted to do . elizabeth had succeeded at sixteen to all that was possible of her mothers rights and consequence and being very handsome and very like himself her influence had always been great and they had gone on together most happily . his two other children were of very inferior value . mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming mrs charles musgrove but anne with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding was nobody with either father or sister her word had no weight her convenience was always to give way she was only anne . to lady russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued goddaughter favourite and friend . lady russell loved them all but it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again . a few years before anne elliot had been a very pretty girl but her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height her father had found little to admire in her so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin to excite his esteem . he had never indulged much hope he had now none of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work . all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune and had therefore given all the honour and received none elizabeth would one day or other marry suitably . it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twentynine than she was ten years before and generally speaking if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost . it was so with elizabeth still the same handsome miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and sir walter might be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at least be deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and elizabeth as blooming as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing . anne haggard mary coarse every face in the neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crows foot about lady russells temples had long been a distress to him . elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment . thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presiding and directing with a selfpossession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was . for thirteen years had she been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at home and leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawingrooms and diningrooms in the country . thirteen winters revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms as she travelled up to london with her father for a few weeks annual enjoyment of the great world . she had the remembrance of all this she had the consciousness of being nineandtwenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever but she felt her approach to the years of danger and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronetblood within the next twelvemonth or two . then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth but now she liked it not . always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister made the book an evil and more than once when her father had left it open on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyes and pushed it away . she had had a disappointment moreover which that book and especially the history of her own family must ever present the remembrance of . the heir presumptive the very william walter elliot esq . whose rights had been so generously supported by her father had disappointed her . she had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to be in the event of her having no brother the future baronet meant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should . he had not been known to them as a boy but soon after lady elliots death sir walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking it making allowance for the modest drawingback of youth and in one of their spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloom mr elliot had been forced into the introduction . he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour was confirmed . he was invited to kellynch hall he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year but he never came . the following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come and the next tidings were that he was married . instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth . sir walter has resented it . as the head of the house he felt that he ought to have been consulted especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand for they must have been seen together he observed once at tattersalls and twice in the lobby of the house of commons . his disapprobation was expressed but apparently very little regarded . mr elliot had attempted no apology and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family as sir walter considered him unworthy of it all acquaintance between them had ceased . this very awkward history of mr elliot was still after an interval of several years felt with anger by elizabeth who had liked the man for himself and still more for being her fathers heir and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter elliots eldest daughter . there was not a baronet from a to z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal . yet so miserably had he conducted himself that though she was at this present time the summer of 1814 wearing black ribbons for his wife she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again . the disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring have been got over had he not done worse but he had as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends they had been informed spoken most disrespectfully of them all most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to and the honours which were hereafter to be his own . this could not be pardoned . such were elizabeth elliots sentiments and sensations such the cares to alloy the agitations to vary the sameness and the elegance the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life such the feelings to give interest to a long uneventful residence in one country circle to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad no talents or accomplishments for home to occupy . but now another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these . her father was growing distressed for money . she knew that when he now took up the baronetage it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hints of mr shepherd his agent from his thoughts . the kellynch property was good but not equal to sir walters apprehension of the state required in its possessor . while lady elliot lived there had been method moderation and economy which had just kept him within his income but with her had died all such rightmindedness and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it . it had not been possible for him to spend less he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot was imperiously called on to do but blameless as he was he was not only growing dreadfully in debt but was hearing of it so often that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer even partially from his daughter . he had given her some hints of it the last spring in town he had gone so far even as to say can we retrench does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench and elizabeth to do her justice had in the first ardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be done and had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut off some unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishing the drawingroom to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to anne as had been the usual yearly custom . but these measures however good in themselves were insufficient for the real extent of the evil the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards . elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy . she felt herself illused and unfortunate as did her father and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne . there was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of but had every acre been alienable it would have made no difference . he had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power but he would never condescend to sell . no he would never disgrace his name so far . the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire as he had received it . their two confidential friends mr shepherd who lived in the neighbouring market town and lady russell were called to advise them and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride . chapter 2 mr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold or his views on sir walter would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hint and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of lady russell from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted . lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it much serious consideration . she was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles . she was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour but she was as desirous of saving sir walters feelings as solicitous for the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well be . she was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of strong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions of decorum and with manners that were held a standard of goodbreeding . she had a cultivated mind and was generally speaking rational and consistent but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry she had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them . herself the widow of only a knight she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due and sir walter independent of his claims as an old acquaintance an attentive neighbour an obliging landlord the husband of her very dear friend the father of anne and her sisters was as being sir walter in her apprehension entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties . they must retrench that did not admit of a doubt . but she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and elizabeth . she drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations and she did what nobody else thought of doing she consulted anne who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question . she consulted and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to sir walter . every emendation of annes had been on the side of honesty against importance . she wanted more vigorous measures a more complete reformation a quicker release from debt a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity . if we can persuade your father to all this said lady russell looking over her paper much may be done . if he will adopt these regulations in seven years he will be clear and i hope we may be able to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions and that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle . what will he be doing in fact but what very many of our first families have done or ought to do there will be nothing singular in his case and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering as it always does of our conduct . i have great hope of prevailing . we must be serious and decided for after all the person who has contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father there is still more due to the character of an honest man . this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding his friends to be urging him . she considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure and saw no dignity in anything short of it . she wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty . she rated lady russells influence highly and as to the severe degree of selfdenial which her own conscience prompted she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete than to half a reformation . her knowledge of her father and elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both and so on through the whole list of lady russells too gentle reductions . how annes more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence . lady russells had no success at all could not be put up with were not to be borne . what every comfort of life knocked off journeys london servants horses table contractions and restrictions every where to live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman no he would sooner quit kellynch hall at once than remain in it on such disgraceful terms . quit kellynch hall . the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd whose interest was involved in the reality of sir walters retrenching and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode . since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side . it did not appear to him that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support . in any other place sir walter might judge for himself and would be looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household . sir walter would quit kellynch hall and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go was settled and the first outline of this important change made out . there had been three alternatives london bath or another house in the country . all annes wishes had been for the latter . a small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have lady russells society still be near mary and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the object of her ambition . but the usual fate of anne attended her in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on . she disliked bath and did not think it agreed with her and bath was to be her home . sir walter had at first thought more of london but mr shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in london and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it and make bath preferred . it was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament he might there be important at comparatively little expense . two material advantages of bath over london had of course been given all their weight its more convenient distance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russells spending some part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction of lady russell whose first views on the projected change had been for bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there . lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear annes known wishes . it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood . anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to sir walters feelings they must have been dreadful . and with regard to annes dislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising first from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there after her mothers death and secondly from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself . lady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to think it must suit them all and as to her young friends health by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge every danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must do both health and spirits good . anne had been too little from home too little seen . her spirits were not high . a larger society would improve them . she wanted her to be more known . the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part and a very material part of the scheme which had been happily engrafted on the beginning . he was not only to quit his home but to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude which stronger heads than sir walters have found too much . kellynch hall was to be let . this however was a profound secret not to be breathed beyond their own circle . sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house . mr shepherd had once mentioned the word advertise but never dared approach it again . sir walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour that he would let it at all . how quick come the reasons for approving what we like lady russell had another excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter and his family were to remove from the country . elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted . it was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned after an unprosperous marriage to her fathers house with the additional burden of two children . she was a clever young woman who understood the art of pleasingthe art of pleasing at least at kellynch hall and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot as to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all that lady russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place could hint of caution and reserve . lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth and seemed to love her rather because she would love her than because elizabeth deserved it . she had never received from her more than outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry against previous inclination . she had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get anne included in the visit to london sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience but always in vain elizabeth would go her own way and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in this selection of mrs clay turning from the society of so deserving a sister to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility . from situation mrs clay was in lady russells estimate a very unequal and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion and a removal that would leave mrs clay behind and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within miss elliots reach was therefore an object of firstrate importance . chapter 3 i must take leave to observe sir walter said mr shepherd one morning at kellynch hall as he laid down the newspaper that the present juncture is much in our favour . this peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore . they will be all wanting a home . could not be a better time sir walter for having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants . many a noble fortune has been made during the war . if a rich admiral were to come in our way sir walter he would be a very lucky man shepherd replied sir walter thats all i have to remark . a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken ever so many before hey shepherd mr shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with . i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with . therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any familymatters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying . sir walter only nodded . but soon afterwards rising and pacing the room he observed sarcastically there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description . they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune said mrs clay for mrs clay was present her father had driven her over nothing being of so much use to mrs clays health as a drive to kellynch but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant . i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe . everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now . you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected . as to all that rejoined sir walter coolly supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it . i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant . the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasuregrounds is another thing . i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden . i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier . after a short pause mr shepherd presumed to say in all these cases there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant . your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands . depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights . i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him . here anne spoke the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give . sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow . very true very true . what miss anne says is very true was mr shepherds rejoinder and oh certainly was his daughters but sir walters remark was soon afterwards the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it . indeed was the reply and with a look of surprise . yes it is in two points offensive to me i have two strong grounds of objection to it . first as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly as it cuts up a mans youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old sooner than any other man . i have observed it all my life . a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in any other line . one day last spring in town i was in company with two men striking instances of what i am talking of lord st ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate without bread to eat i was to give place to lord st ives and a certain admiral baldwin the most deplorablelooking personage you can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged to the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side and nothing but a dab of powder at top . in the name of heaven who is that old fellow said i to a friend of mine who was standing near sir basil morley . old fellow cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin . what do you take his age to be sixty said i or perhaps sixtytwo . forty replied sir basil forty and no more . picture to yourselves my amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin . i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a seafaring life can do but to a degree i know it is the same with them all they are all knocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather till they are not fit to be seen . it is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once before they reach admiral baldwins age . nay sir walter cried mrs clay this is being severe indeed . have a little mercy on the poor men . we are not all born to be handsome . the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth . but then is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the body which seldom leaves a mans looks to the natural effect of time . the lawyer plods quite careworn the physician is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even the clergyman she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergymanand even the clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere . in fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and living on their own property without the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young . it seemed as if mr shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak sir walters good will towards a naval officer as tenant had been gifted with foresight for the very first application for the house was from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton and indeed he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent . by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make admiral croft was a native of somersetshire who having acquired a very handsome fortune was wishing to settle in his own country and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him that accidentally hearingit was just as he had foretold mr shepherd observed sir walters concerns could not be kept a secret accidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let and understanding his mr shepherds connection with the owner he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries and had in the course of a pretty long conference expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel and given mr shepherd in his explicit account of himself every proof of his being a most responsible eligible tenant . and who is admiral croft was sir walters cold suspicious inquiry . mr shepherd answered for his being of a gentlemans family and mentioned a place and anne after the little pause which followed added he is a rear admiral of the white . he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years . then i take it for granted observed sir walter that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery . mr shepherd hastened to assure him that admiral croft was a very hale hearty welllooking man a little weatherbeaten to be sure but not much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanted a comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possible knew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent a readyfurnished house of that consequence might fetch should not have been surprised if sir walter had asked more had inquired about the manor would be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of it said he sometimes took out a gun but never killed quite the gentleman . mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out all the circumstances of the admirals family which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant . he was a married man and without children the very state to be wished for . a house was never taken good care of mr shepherd observed without a lady he did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady as where there were many children . a lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture in the world . he had seen mrs croft too she was at taunton with the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over . and a very wellspoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be continued he asked more questions about the house and terms and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once she told me so herself sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford . bless me what was his name at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately . penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford mrs crofts brother but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot that she did not hear the appeal . i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent . bless me how very odd i shall forget my own name soon i suppose . a name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman so well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once i remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmers man breaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen caught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement submitted to an amicable compromise . very odd indeed after waiting another moment you mean mr wentworth i suppose said anne . mr shepherd was all gratitude . wentworth was the very name mr wentworth was the very man . he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back for two or three years . came there about the year 5 i take it . you remember him i am sure . wentworth oh aymr wentworth the curate of monkford . you misled me by the term gentleman . i thought you were speaking of some man of property mr wentworth was nobody i remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family . one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common . as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them no service with sir walter he mentioned it no more returning with all his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour their age and number and fortune the high idea they had formed of kellynch hall and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot an extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed in the secret of sir walters estimate of the dues of a tenant . it succeeded however and though sir walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty and authorising him to wait on admiral croft who still remained at taunton and fix a day for the house being seen . sir walter was not very wise but still he had experience enough of the world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenant in all essentials than admiral croft bid fair to be could hardly offer . so far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing in the admirals situation in life which was just high enough and not too high . i have let my house to admiral croft would sound extremely well very much better than to any mere mr a mr save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs a note of explanation . an admiral speaks his own consequence and at the same time can never make a baronet look small . in all their dealings and intercourse sir walter elliot must ever have the precedence . nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her . mr shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner had such an end been reached than anne who had been a most attentive listener to the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove said with a gentle sigh a few months more and he perhaps may be walking here . chapter 4 he was not mr wentworth the former curate of monkford however suspicious appearances may be but a captain frederick wentworth his brother who being made commander in consequence of the action off st domingo and not immediately employed had come into somersetshire in the summer of 1806 and having no parent living found a home for half a year at monkford . he was at that time a remarkably fine young man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy and anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste and feeling . half the sum of attraction on either side might have been enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail . they were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and deeply in love . it would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest she in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in having them accepted . a short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one . troubles soon arose . sir walter on being applied to without actually withholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all the negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter . he thought it a very degrading alliance and lady russell though with more tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one . anne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind to throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself to recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances of a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away which she grieved to think of anne elliot so young known to so few to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxious youthkilling dependence it must not be if by any fair interference of friendship any representations from one who had almost a mothers love and mothers rights it would be prevented . captain wentworth had no fortune . he had been lucky in his profession but spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing . but he was confident that he should soon be rich full of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted . he had always been lucky he knew he should be so still . such confidence powerful in its own warmth and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it must have been enough for anne but lady russell saw it very differently . his sanguine temper and fearlessness of mind operated very differently on her . she saw in it but an aggravation of the evil . it only added a dangerous character to himself . he was brilliant he was headstrong . lady russell had little taste for wit and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror . she deprecated the connexion in every light . such opposition as these feelings produced was more than anne could combat . young and gentle as she was it might yet have been possible to withstand her fathers illwill though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister but lady russell whom she had always loved and relied on could not with such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of manner be continually advising her in vain . she was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing indiscreet improper hardly capable of success and not deserving it . but it was not a merely selfish caution under which she acted in putting an end to it . had she not imagined herself consulting his good even more than her own she could hardly have given him up . the belief of being prudent and selfdenying principally for his advantage was her chief consolation under the misery of a parting a final parting and every consolation was required for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions on his side totally unconvinced and unbending and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment . he had left the country in consequence . a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance but not with a few months ended annes share of suffering from it . her attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every enjoyment of youth and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect . more than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close and time had softened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him but she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given in change of place except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture or in any novelty or enlargement of society . no one had ever come within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with frederick wentworth as he stood in her memory . no second attachment the only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure at her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind the fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society around them . she had been solicited when about twoandtwenty to change her name by the young man who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister and lady russell had lamented her refusal for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man whose landed property and general importance were second in that country only to sir walters and of good character and appearance and however lady russell might have asked yet for something more while anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twentytwo so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her fathers house and settled so permanently near herself . but in this case anne had left nothing for advice to do and though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion never wished the past undone she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for annes being tempted by some man of talents and independence to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits . they knew not each others opinion either its constancy or its change on the one leading point of annes conduct for the subject was never alluded to but anne at sevenandtwenty thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen . she did not blame lady russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her but she felt that were any young person in similar circumstances to apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good . she was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home and every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears delays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it and this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs without reference to the actual results of their case which as it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on . all his sanguine expectations all his confidence had been justified . his genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path . he had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ and all that he had told her would follow had taken place . he had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rank and must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortune . she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority but she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy she had no reason to believe him married . how eloquent could anne elliot have been how eloquent at least were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful confidence in futurity against that overanxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust providence she had been forced into prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning . with all these circumstances recollections and feelings she could not hear that captain wentworths sister was likely to live at kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a stroll and many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea . she often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts and their business no evil . she was assisted however by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it . she could do justice to the superiority of lady russells motives in this over those of her father and elizabeth she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung and in the event of admiral crofts really taking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her of the past being known to those three only among her connexions by whom no syllable she believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among his the brother only with whom he had been residing had received any information of their shortlived engagement . that brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover a single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creatures having heard of it from him . the sister mrs croft had then been out of england accompanying her husband on a foreign station and her own sister mary had been at school while it all occurred and never admitted by the pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards . with these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynch and mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated need not involve any particular awkwardness . chapter 5 on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs crofts seeing kellynch hall anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russells and keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them . this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory and decided the whole business at once . each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore but good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen there was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberality on the admirals side as could not but influence sir walter who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by mr shepherds assurances of his being known by report to the admiral as a model of good breeding . the house and grounds and furniture were approved the crofts were approved terms time every thing and every body was right and mr shepherds clerks were set to work without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that this indenture sheweth . sir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be the bestlooking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where and the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife as they drove back through the park i thought we should soon come to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at taunton . the baronet will never set the thames on fire but there seems to be no harm in him . reciprocal compliments which would have been esteemed about equal . the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas and as sir walter proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement . lady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use or any importance in the choice of the house which they were going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagements of her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks she was unable to give the full invitation she wished and anne though dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare of bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country did not think that everything considered she wished to remain . it would be most right and most wise and therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others . something occurred however to give her a different duty . mary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne when anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing that she should not have a days health all the autumn entreated or rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come to uppercross cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her instead of going to bath . i cannot possibly do without anne was marys reasoning and elizabeths reply was then i am sure anne had better stay for nobody will want her in bath . to be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least better than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad to be thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country and her own dear country readily agreed to stay . this invitation of marys removed all lady russells difficulties and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath till lady russell took her and that all the intervening time should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge . so far all was perfectly right but lady russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her which was mrs clays being engaged to go to bath with sir walter and elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her . lady russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered grieved and feared and the affront it contained to anne in mrs clays being of so much use while anne could be of none was a very sore aggravation . anne herself was become hardened to such affronts but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell . with a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge which she often wished less of her fathers character she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible . she did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind . mrs clay had freckles and a projecting tooth and a clumsy wrist which he was continually making severe remarks upon in her absence but she was young and certainly altogether welllooking and possessed in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been . anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister . she had little hope of success but elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought have reason to reproach her for giving no warning . she spoke and seemed only to offend . elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly answered for each partys perfectly knowing their situation . mrs clay said she warmly never forgets who she is and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people . and as to my father i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single so long for our sakes need be suspected now . if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her so much with me not that anything in the world i am sure would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy . but poor mrs clay who with all her merits can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety . one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes though i know you must fifty times . that tooth of hers and those freckles . freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him . i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few but he abominates them . you must have heard him notice mrs clays freckles . there is hardly any personal defect replied anne which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to . i think very differently answered elizabeth shortly an agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never alter plain ones . however at any rate as i have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me . anne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless of doing good . elizabeth though resenting the suspicion might yet be made observant by it . the last office of the four carriagehorses was to draw sir walter miss elliot and mrs clay to bath . the party drove off in very good spirits sir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves and anne walked up at the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity to the lodge where she was to spend the first week . her friend was not in better spirits than herself . lady russell felt this breakup of the family exceedingly . their respectability was as dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit . it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up anne . accordingly their removal was made together and anne was set down at uppercross cottage in the first stage of lady russells journey . uppercross was a moderatesized village which a few years back had been completely in the old english style containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers the mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees substantial and unmodernized and the compact tight parsonage enclosed in its own neat garden with a vine and a peartree trained round its casements but upon the marriage of the young squire it had received the improvement of a farmhouse elevated into a cottage for his residence and uppercross cottage with its veranda french windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catch the travellers eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther on . here anne had often been staying . she knew the ways of uppercross as well as those of kellynch . the two families were so continually meeting so much in the habit of running in and out of each others house at all hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone but being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course . though better endowed than the elder sister mary had not annes understanding nor temper . while well and happy and properly attended to she had great good humour and excellent spirits but any indisposition sunk her completely . she had no resources for solitude and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot selfimportance was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and illused . in person she was inferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached the dignity of being a fine girl . she was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawingroom the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers and two children and on annes appearing greeted her with so you are come at last i began to think i should never see you . i am so ill i can hardly speak . i have not seen a creature the whole morning i am sorry to find you unwell replied anne . you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday yes i made the best of it i always do but i was very far from well at the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life as i have been all this morning very unfit to be left alone i am sure . suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way and not able to ring the bell so lady russell would not get out . i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer . anne said what was proper and enquired after her husband . oh charles is out shooting . i have not seen him since seven oclock . he would go though i told him how ill i was . he said he should not stay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one . i assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning . you have had your little boys with you yes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good . little charles does not mind a word i say and walter is growing quite as bad . well you will soon be better now replied anne cheerfully . you know i always cure you when i come . how are your neighbours at the great house i can give you no account of them . i have not seen one of them today except mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window but without getting off his horse and though i told him how ill i was not one of them have been near me . it did not happen to suit the miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselves out of their way . you will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone . it is early . i never want them i assure you . they talk and laugh a great deal too much for me . oh anne i am so very unwell it was quite unkind of you not to come on thursday . my dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well and in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last and besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busy have had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have left kellynch sooner . dear me what can you possibly have to do a great many things i assure you . more than i can recollect in a moment but i can tell you some . i have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my fathers books and pictures . i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeths plants are for lady russell . i have had all my own little concerns to arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature going to almost every house in the parish as a sort of takeleave . i was told that they wished it . but all these things took up a great deal of time . oh well and after a moments pause but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday . did you go then i have made no enquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party . oh yes i went . i was very well yesterday nothing at all the matter with me till this morning . it would have been strange if i had not gone . i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party . nothing remarkable . one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of ones own . mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were so crowded they are both so very large and take up so much room and mr musgrove always sits forward . so there was i crowded into the back seat with henrietta and louise and i think it very likely that my illness today may be owing to it . a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on annes side produced nearly a cure on marys . she could soon sit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinnertime . then forgetting to think of it she was at the other end of the room beautifying a nosegay then she ate her cold meat and then she was well enough to propose a little walk . where shall we go said she when they were ready . i suppose you will not like to call at the great house before they have been to see you i have not the smallest objection on that account replied anne . i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs and the miss musgroves . oh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible . they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister . however we may as well go and sit with them a little while and when we have that over we can enjoy our walk . anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent but she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that though there were on each side continual subjects of offence neither family could now do without it . to the great house accordingly they went to sit the full half hour in the oldfashioned square parlour with a small carpet and shining floor to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand pianoforte and a harp flowerstands and little tables placed in every direction . oh could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness the portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment . the musgroves like their houses were in a state of alteration perhaps of improvement . the father and mother were in the old english style and the young people in the new . mr and mrs musgrove were a very good sort of people friendly and hospitable not much educated and not at all elegant . their children had more modern minds and manners . there was a numerous family but the only two grown up excepting charles were henrietta and louisa young ladies of nineteen and twenty who had brought from school at exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousands of other young ladies living to be fashionable happy and merry . their dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty their spirits extremely good their manner unembarrassed and pleasant they were of consequence at home and favourites abroad . anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together that goodhumoured mutual affection of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters . they were received with great cordiality . nothing seemed amiss on the side of the great house family which was generally as anne very well knew the least to blame . the half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough and she was not at all surprised at the end of it to have their walking party joined by both the miss musgroves at marys particular invitation . chapter 6 anne had not wanted this visit to uppercross to learn that a removal from one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles will often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea . she had never been staying there before without being struck by it or without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs which at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest yet with all this experience she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her for certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove so miss anne sir walter and your sister are gone and what part of bath do you think they will settle in and this without much waiting for an answer or in the young ladies addition of i hope we shall be in bath in the winter but remember papa if we do go we must be in a good situation none of your queen squares for us or in the anxious supplement from mary of upon my word i shall be pretty well off when you are all gone away to be happy at bath she could only resolve to avoid such selfdelusion in future and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell . the mr musgroves had their own game to guard and to destroy their own horses dogs and newspapers to engage them and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping neighbours dress dancing and music . she acknowledged it to be very fitting that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse and hoped ere long to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into . with the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination her memory and all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible . she had no dread of these two months . mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as elizabeth nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort . she was always on friendly terms with her brotherinlaw and in the children who loved her nearly as well and respected her a great deal more than their mother she had an object of interest amusement and wholesome exertion . charles musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation or grace to make the past as they were connected together at all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time anne could believe with lady russell that a more equal match might have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness rationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits . as it was he did nothing with much zeal but sport and his time was otherwise trifled away without benefit from books or anything else . he had very good spirits which never seemed much affected by his wifes occasional lowness bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to annes admiration and upon the whole though there was very often a little disagreement in which she had sometimes more share than she wished being appealed to by both parties they might pass for a happy couple . they were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father but here as on most topics he had the superiority for while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made he always contended for his fathers having many other uses for his money and a right to spend it as he liked . as to the management of their children his theory was much better than his wifes and his practice not so bad . i could manage them very well if it were not for marys interference was what anne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in but when listening in turn to marys reproach of charles spoils the children so that i cannot get them into any order she never had the smallest temptation to say very true . one of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house . known to have some influence with her sister she was continually requested or at least receiving hints to exert it beyond what was practicable . i wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill was charless language and in an unhappy mood thus spoke mary i do believe if charles were to see me dying he would not think there was anything the matter with me . i am sure anne if you would you might persuade him that i really am very illa great deal worse than i ever own . marys declaration was i hate sending the children to the great house though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them for she humours and indulges them to such a degree and gives them so much trash and sweet things that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day . and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with anne to say oh miss anne i cannot help wishing mrs charles had a little of your method with those children . they are quite different creatures with you but to be sure in general they are so spoilt it is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them . they are as fine healthy children as ever were seen poor little dears without partiality but mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated bless me how troublesome they are sometimes . i assure you miss anne it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as i otherwise should . i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment dont do this and dont do that or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them . she had this communication moreover from mary . mrs musgrove thinks all her servants so steady that it would be high treason to call it in question but i am sure without exaggeration that her upper housemaid and laundrymaid instead of being in their business are gadding about the village all day long . i meet them wherever i go and i declare i never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them . if jemima were not the trustiest steadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her for she tells me they are always tempting her to take a walk with them . and on mrs musgroves side it was i make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughterinlaws concerns for i know it would not do but i shall tell you miss anne because you may be able to set things to rights that i have no very good opinion of mrs charless nurserymaid i hear strange stories of her she is always upon the gad and from my own knowledge i can declare she is such a finedressing lady that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near . mrs charles quite swears by her i know but i just give you this hint that you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amiss you need not be afraid of mentioning it . again it was marys complaint that mrs musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due when they dined at the great house with other families and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place . and one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves one of them after talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank said i have no scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons are about their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma . nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it . it is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world but i know it is taken notice of by many persons . how was anne to set all these matters to rights she could do little more than listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each to the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sisters benefit . in all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well . her own spirits improved by change of place and subject by being removed three miles from kellynch marys ailments lessened by having a constant companion and their daily intercourse with the other family since there was neither superior affection confidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it was rather an advantage . it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible for they met every morning and hardly ever spent an evening asunder but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of mr and mrs musgroves respectable forms in the usual places or without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters . she played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves but having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents to sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance was little thought of only out of civility or to refresh the others as she was well aware . she knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself but this was no new sensation . excepting one short period of her life she had never since the age of fourteen never since the loss of her dear mother known the happiness of being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste . in music she had been always used to feel alone in the world and mr and mrs musgroves fond partiality for their own daughters performance and total indifference to any other persons gave her much more pleasure for their sakes than mortification for her own . the party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company . the neighbourhood was not large but the musgroves were visited by everybody and had more dinnerparties and more callers more visitors by invitation and by chance than any other family . there were more completely popular . the girls were wild for dancing and the evenings ended occasionally in an unpremeditated little ball . there was a family of cousins within a walk of uppercross in less affluent circumstances who depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures they would come at any time and help play at anything or dance anywhere and anne very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post played country dances to them by the hour together a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove more than anything else and often drew this compliment well done miss anne very well done indeed lord bless me how those little fingers of yours fly about so passed the first three weeks . michaelmas came and now annes heart must be in kellynch again . a beloved home made over to others all the precious rooms and furniture groves and prospects beginning to own other eyes and other limbs she could not think of much else on the 29th of september and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from mary who on having occasion to note down the day of the month exclaimed dear me is not this the day the crofts were to come to kellynch i am glad i did not think of it before . how low it makes me the crofts took possession with true naval alertness and were to be visited . mary deplored the necessity for herself . nobody knew how much she should suffer . she should put it off as long as she could but was not easy till she had talked charles into driving her over on an early day and was in a very animated comfortable state of imaginary agitation when she came back . anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going . she wished however to see the crofts and was glad to be within when the visit was returned . they came the master of the house was not at home but the two sisters were together and as it chanced that mrs croft fell to the share of anne while the admiral sat by mary and made himself very agreeable by his goodhumoured notice of her little boys she was well able to watch for a likeness and if it failed her in the features to catch it in the voice or in the turn of sentiment and expression . mrs croft though neither tall nor fat had a squareness uprightness and vigour of form which gave importance to her person . she had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face though her reddened and weatherbeaten complexion the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eightandthirty . her manners were open easy and decided like one who had no distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do without any approach to coarseness however or any want of good humour . anne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration towards herself in all that related to kellynch and it pleased her especially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute in the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs crofts side to give a bias of any sort . she was quite easy on that head and consequently full of strength and courage till for a moment electrified by mrs crofts suddenly saying it was you and not your sister i find that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country . anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing but the age of emotion she certainly had not . perhaps you may not have heard that he is married added mrs croft . she could now answer as she ought and was happy to feel when mrs crofts next words explained it to be mr wentworth of whom she spoke that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother . she immediately felt how reasonable it was that mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward and not of frederick and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbours present state with proper interest . the rest was all tranquillity till just as they were moving she heard the admiral say to mary we are expecting a brother of mrs crofts here soon i dare say you know him by name . he was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys clinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets c .  to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun anne was left to persuade herself as well as she could that the same brother must still be in question . she could not however reach such a degree of certainty as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house where the crofts had previously been calling . the folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day at the cottage and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened for when the youngest miss musgrove walked in . that she was coming to apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves was the first black idea and mary was quite ready to be affronted when louisa made all right by saying that she only came on foot to leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage . and i will tell you our reason she added and all about it . i am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much of poor richard and we agreed it would be best to have the harp for it seems to amuse her more than the pianoforte . i will tell you why she is out of spirits . when the crofts called this morning they called here afterwards did not they they happened to say that her brother captain wentworth is just returned to england or paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly and most unluckily it came into mammas head when they were gone that wentworth or something very like it was the name of poor richards captain at one time i do not know when or where but a great while before he died poor fellow and upon looking over his letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it and of poor richard so we must be as merry as we can that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things . the real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were that the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome hopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family though quite as much as he deserved seldom heard of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross two years before . he had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him by calling him poor richard been nothing better than a thickheaded unfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name living or dead . he had been several years at sea and had in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on board captain frederick wentworths frigate the laconia and from the laconia he had under the influence of his captain written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence that is to say the only two disinterested letters all the rest had been mere applications for money . in each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yet so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships that it had made scarcely any impression at the time and that mrs musgrove should have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection of the name of wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur . she had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposed and the reperusal of these letters after so long an interval her poor son gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgotten had affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death . mr musgrove was in a lesser degree affected likewise and when they reached the cottage they were evidently in want first of being listened to anew on this subject and afterwards of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them . to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth repeating his name so often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it might that it probably would turn out to be the very same captain wentworth whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back from cliftona very fine young manbut they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to annes nerves . she found however that it was one to which she must inure herself . since he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself to be insensible on such points . and not only did it appear that he was expected and speedily but the musgroves in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor dick and very high respect for his character stamped as it was by poor dicks having been six months under his care and mentioning him in strong though not perfectly wellspelt praise as a fine dashing felow only two perticular about the schoolmaster were bent on introducing themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon as they could hear of his arrival . the resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening . chapter 7 a very few days more and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch and mr musgrove had called on him and come back warm in his praise and he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross by the end of another week . it had been a great disappointment to mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed so impatient was he to shew his gratitude by seeing captain wentworth under his own roof and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars . but a week must pass only a week in annes reckoning and then she supposed they must meet and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week . captain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgroves civility and she was all but calling there in the same half hour . she and mary were actually setting forward for the great house where as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him when they were stopped by the eldest boys being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall . the childs situation put the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escape with indifference even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account . his collarbone was found to be dislocated and such injury received in the back as roused the most alarming ideas . it was an afternoon of distress and anne had every thing to do at once the apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed the mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to control the youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it proper notice to the other house which brought her an accession rather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistants . her brothers return was the first comfort he could take best care of his wife and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary . till he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were the worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where but now the collarbone was soon replaced and though mr robinson felt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind and then it was just before they parted that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephews state as to give the information of captain wentworths visit staying five minutes behind their father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance who had been at all a favourite before . how glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mammas farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrowactually on the morrow and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought . and in short he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace that they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him and off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparently more full of captain wentworth than of little charles . the same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls came with their father through the gloom of the evening to make enquiries and mr musgrove no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir could add his confirmation and praise and hope there would be now no occasion for putting captain wentworth off and only be sorry to think that the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy to give him the meeting . oh no as to leaving the little boy both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought and anne in the joy of the escape could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs . charles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination the child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced to captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour . but in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with oh no indeed charles i cannot bear to have you go away . only think if anything should happen the child had a good night and was going on well the next day . it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm and charles musgrove began consequently to feel no necessity for longer confinement . the child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible but what was there for a father to do this was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in him who could be of no use at home to shut himself up . his father very much wished him to meet captain wentworth and there being no sufficient reason against it he ought to go and it ended in his making a bold public declaration when he came in from shooting of his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other house . nothing can be going on better than the child said he so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me quite right . your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all . you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use . anne will send for me if anything is the matter . husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain . mary knew from charless manner of speaking that he was quite determined on going and that it would be of no use to teaze him . she said nothing therefore till he was out of the room but as soon as there was only anne to hear so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this poor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening i knew how it would be . this is always my luck . if there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it and charles is as bad as any of them . very unfeeling i must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy . talks of his being going on so well how does he know that he is going on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling . so here he is to go away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother i am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child . my being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried . i am not at all equal to it . you saw how hysterical i was yesterday . but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm of the shock . you will not be hysterical again . i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us . i perfectly understand mr robinsons directions and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband . nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province . a sick child is always the mothers property her own feelings generally make it so . i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know that i am of any more use in the sickroom than charles for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill and you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet he was sure to begin kicking about . i have not nerves for the sort of thing . but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy yes you see his papa can and why should not i jemima is so careful and she could send us word every hour how he was . i really think charles might as well have told his father we would all come . i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is . i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different today . well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself suppose you were to go as well as your husband . leave little charles to my care . mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain with him . are you serious cried mary her eyes brightening . dear me thats a very good thought very good indeed . to be sure i may just as well go as not for i am of no use at homeam i and it only harasses me . you who have not a mothers feelings are a great deal the properest person . you can make little charles do anything he always minds you at a word . it will be a great deal better than leaving him only with jemima . oh i shall certainly go i am sure i ought if i can quite as much as charles for they want me excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth and i know you do not mind being left alone . an excellent thought of yours indeed anne . i will go and tell charles and get ready directly . you can send for us you know at a moments notice if anything is the matter but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you . i should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at ease about my dear child . the next moment she was tapping at her husbands dressingroom door and as anne followed her up stairs she was in time for the whole conversation which began with marys saying in a tone of great exultation i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home than you are . if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like . anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him . it is annes own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be a great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday . this is very kind of anne was her husbands answer and i should be very glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself to nurse our sick child . anne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction was at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening when the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable and this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits . they were gone she hoped to be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem as for herself she was left with as many sensations of comfort as were perhaps ever likely to be hers . she knew herself to be of the first utility to the child and what was it to her if frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant making himself agreeable to others she would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting . perhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances . he must be either indifferent or unwilling . had he wished ever to see her again he need not have waited till this time he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting . her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance and their visit in general . there had been music singing talking laughing all that was most agreeable charming manners in captain wentworth no shyness or reserve they seemed all to know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with charles . he was to come to breakfast but not at the cottage though that had been proposed at first but then he had been pressed to come to the great house instead and he seemed afraid of being in mrs charles musgroves way on account of the child and therefore somehow they hardly knew how it ended in charless being to meet him to breakfast at his fathers . anne understood it . he wished to avoid seeing her . he had inquired after her she found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintance seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhaps by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet . the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those of the other house and on the morrow the difference was so great that mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when charles came in to say that they were just setting off that he was come for his dogs that his sisters were following with captain wentworth his sisters meaning to visit mary and the child and captain wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient and though charles had answered for the childs being in no such state as could make it inconvenient captain wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice . mary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him while a thousand feelings rushed on anne of which this was the most consoling that it would soon be over . and it was soon over . in two minutes after charless preparation the others appeared they were in the drawingroom . her eye half met captain wentworths a bow a curtsey passed she heard his voice he talked to mary said all that was right said something to the miss musgroves enough to mark an easy footing the room seemed full full of persons and voices but a few minutes ended it . charles shewed himself at the window all was ready their visitor had bowed and was gone the miss musgroves were gone too suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen the room was cleared and anne might finish her breakfast as she could . it is over it is over she repeated to herself again and again in nervous gratitude . the worst is over mary talked but she could not attend . she had seen him . they had met . they had been once more in the same room . soon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling less . eight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up . how absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness what might not eight years do events of every description changes alienations removalsall all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past how natural how certain too it included nearly a third part of her own life . alas with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing . now how were his sentiments to be read was this like wishing to avoid her and the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question . on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense for after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary  captain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he was so attentive to me . henrietta asked him what he thought of you when they went away and he said you were so altered he should not have known you again . mary had no feelings to make her respect her sisters in a common way but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound . altered beyond his knowledge . anne fully submitted in silent deep mortification . doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge for he was not altered or not for the worse . she had already acknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently let him think of her as he would . no the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly open look in no respect lessening his personal advantages . she had seen the same frederick wentworth . so altered that he should not have known her again these were words which could not but dwell with her . yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them . they were of sobering tendency they allayed agitation they composed and consequently must make her happier . frederick wentworth had used such words or something like them but without an idea that they would be carried round to her . he had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal had spoken as he felt . he had not forgiven anne elliot . she had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided confident temper could not endure . she had given him up to oblige others . it had been the effect of overpersuasion . it had been weakness and timidity . he had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation of curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again . her power with him was gone for ever . it was now his object to marry . he was rich and being turned on shore fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted actually looking round ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow . he had a heart for either of the miss musgroves if they could catch it a heart in short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way excepting anne elliot . this was his only secret exception when he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions yes here i am sophia quite ready to make a foolish match . anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking . a little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy and i am a lost man . should not this be enough for a sailor who has had no society among women to make him nice he said it she knew to be contradicted . his bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice and anne elliot was not out of his thoughts when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with . a strong mind with sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the description . that is the woman i want said he . something a little inferior i shall of course put up with but it must not be much . if i am a fool i shall be a fool indeed for i have thought on the subject more than most men . chapter 8 from this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly in the same circle . they were soon dining in company together at mr musgroves for the little boys state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings . whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each they could not but be reverted to the year of their engagement could not but be named by him in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth . his profession qualified him his disposition lead him to talk and that was in the year six that happened before i went to sea in the year six occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together and though his voice did not falter and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke anne felt the utter impossibility from her knowledge of his mind that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself . there must be the same immediate association of thought though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain . they had no conversation together no intercourse but what the commonest civility required . once so much to each other now nothing there had been a time when of all the large party now filling the drawingroom at uppercross they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another . with the exception perhaps of admiral and mrs croft who seemed particularly attached and happy anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples there could have been no two hearts so open no tastes so similar no feelings so in unison no countenances so beloved . now they were as strangers nay worse than strangers for they could never become acquainted . it was a perpetual estrangement . when he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind . there was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party and he was very much questioned and especially by the two miss musgroves who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the manner of living on board daily regulations food hours c .  and their surprise at his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable drew from him some pleasant ridicule which reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat or any cook to dress it if there were or any servant to wait or any knife and fork to use . from thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisper of mrs musgroves who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying ah miss anne if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son i dare say he would have been just such another by this time . anne suppressed a smile and listened kindly while mrs musgrove relieved her heart a little more and for a few minutes therefore could not keep pace with the conversation of the others . when she could let her attention take its natural course again she found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list their own navy list the first that had ever been at uppercross and sitting down together to pore over it with the professed view of finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded . your first was the asp i remember we will look for the asp . you will not find her there . quite worn out and broken up . i was the last man who commanded her . hardly fit for service then . reported fit for home service for a year or two and so i was sent off to the west indies . the girls looked all amazement . the admiralty he continued entertain themselves now and then with sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed . but they have a great many to provide for and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed . phoo phoo cried the admiral what stuff these young fellows talk never was a better sloop than the asp in her day . for an old built sloop you would not see her equal . lucky fellow to get her he knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time . lucky fellow to get anything so soon with no more interest than his . i felt my luck admiral i assure you replied captain wentworth seriously . i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire . it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea a very great object i wanted to be doing something . to be sure you did . what should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together if a man had not a wife he soon wants to be afloat again . but captain wentworth cried louisa how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you . i knew pretty well what she was before that day said he smiling . i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself . ah she was a dear old asp to me . she did all that i wanted . i knew she would . i knew that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted . i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck . we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition . fourandtwenty hours later and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me . annes shudderings were to herself alone but the miss musgroves could be as open as they were sincere in their exclamations of pity and horror . and so then i suppose said mrs musgrove in a low voice as if thinking aloud so then he went away to the laconia and there he met with our poor boy . charles my dear beckoning him to her do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother . i always forgot . it was at gibraltar mother i know . dick had been left ill at gibraltar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth . oh but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend . charles being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case only nodded in reply and walked away . the girls were now hunting for the laconia and captain wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate and present noncommissioned class observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had . ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia how fast i made money in her . a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands . poor harville sister you know how much he wanted money worse than myself . he had a wife . excellent fellow . i shall never forget his happiness . he felt it all so much for her sake . i wished for him again the next summer when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean . and i am sure sir . said mrs musgrove it was a lucky day for us when you were put captain into that ship . we shall never forget what you did . her feelings made her speak low and captain wentworth hearing only in part and probably not having dick musgrove at all near his thoughts looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for more . my brother whispered one of the girls mamma is thinking of poor richard . poor dear fellow continued mrs musgrove he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care ah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you . i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you . there was a momentary expression in captain wentworths face at this speech a certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth which convinced anne that instead of sharing in mrs musgroves kind wishes as to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him but it was too transient an indulgence of selfamusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting took a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her in a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parents feelings . they were actually on the same sofa for mrs musgrove had most readily made room for him they were divided only by mrs musgrove . it was no insignificant barrier indeed . mrs musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment and while the agitations of annes slender form and pensive face may be considered as very completely screened captain wentworth should be allowed some credit for the selfcommand with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son whom alive nobody had cared for . personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions . a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction as the most graceful set of limbs in the world . but fair or not fair there are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize in vain which taste cannot toleratewhich ridicule will seize . the admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him being called to order by his wife now came up to captain wentworth and without any observation of what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughts began with if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters . should i i am glad i was not a week later then . the admiral abused him for his want of gallantry . he defended himself though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his excepting for a ball or a visit which a few hours might comprehend . but if i know myself said he this is from no want of gallantry towards them . it is rather from feeling how impossible it is with all ones efforts and all ones sacrifices to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have . there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high and this is what i do . i hate to hear of women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it . this brought his sister upon him . oh frederick but i cannot believe it of you . all idle refinement women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england . i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a manofwar . i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall with a kind bow to anne beyond what i always had in most of the ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether . nothing to the purpose replied her brother . you were living with your husband and were the only woman on board . but you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin and three children round from portsmouth to plymouth . where was this superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then all merged in my friendship sophia . i would assist any brother officers wife that i could and i would bring anything of harvilles from the worlds end if he wanted it . but do not imagine that i did not feel it an evil in itself . depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable . i might not like them the better for that perhaps . such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board . my dear frederick you are talking quite idly . pray what would become of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth . but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman and as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures . we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days . ah my dear said the admiral when he had got a wife he will sing a different tune . when he is married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many others have done . we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife . ay that we shall . now i have done cried captain wentworth . when once married people begin to attack me withoh you will think very differently when you are married . i can only say no i shall not and then they say again yes you will and there is an end of it . he got up and moved away . what a great traveller you must have been maam said mrs musgrove to mrs croft . pretty well maam in the fifteen years of my marriage though many women have done more . i have crossed the atlantic four times and have been once to the east indies and back again and only once besides being in different places about home cork and lisbon and gibraltar . but i never went beyond the streights and never was in the west indies . we do not call bermuda or bahama you know the west indies . mrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life . and i do assure you maam pursued mrs croft that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a manofwar i speak you know of the higher rates . when you come to a frigate of course you are more confined though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them and i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship . while we were together you know there was nothing to be feared . thank god i have always been blessed with excellent health and no climate disagrees with me . a little disordered always the first twentyfour hours of going to sea but never knew what sickness was afterwards . the only time i ever really suffered in body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell or had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by myself at deal when the admiral captain croft then was in the north seas . i lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself or when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be together nothing ever ailed me and i never met with the smallest inconvenience . aye to be sure . yes indeed oh yes i am quite of your opinion mrs croft was mrs musgroves hearty answer . there is nothing so bad as a separation . i am quite of your opinion . i know what it is for mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when they are over and he is safe back again . the evening ended with dancing . on its being proposed anne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely glad to be employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved . it was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits than captain wentworth . she felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference and especially the attention of all the young women could do . the miss hayters the females of the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him and as for henrietta and louisa they both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect goodwill between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals . if he were a little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration who could wonder these were some of the thoughts which occupied anne while her fingers were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together equally without error and without consciousness . once she felt that he was looking at herself observing her altered features perhaps trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him and once she knew that he must have spoken of her she was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced the answer was oh no never she has quite given up dancing . she had rather play . she is never tired of playing . once too he spoke to her . she had left the instrument on the dancing being over and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the miss musgroves an idea of . unintentionally she returned to that part of the room he saw her and instantly rising said with studied politeness i beg your pardon madam this is your seat and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative he was not to be induced to sit down again . anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches . his cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything . chapter 9 captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stay as long as he liked being as thoroughly the object of the admirals fraternal kindness as of his wifes . he had intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshire and visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions of uppercross induced him to put this off . there was so much of friendliness and of flattery and of everything most bewitching in his reception there the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable that he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all the charms and perfections of edwards wife upon credit a little longer . it was soon uppercross with him almost every day . the musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularly in the morning when he had no companion at home for the admiral and mrs croft were generally out of doors together interesting themselves in their new possessions their grass and their sheep and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person or driving out in a gig lately added to their establishment . hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth among the musgroves and their dependencies . it was unvarying warm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more than established when a certain charles hayter returned among them to be a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain wentworth very much in the way . charles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins and a very amiable pleasing young man between whom and henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworths introduction . he was in orders and having a curacy in the neighbourhood where residence was not required lived at his fathers house only two miles from uppercross . a short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners and of seeing captain wentworth . mrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters . they had each had money but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence . mr hayter had some property of his own but it was insignificant compared with mr musgroves and while the musgroves were in the first class of society in the country the young hayters would from their parents inferior retired and unpolished way of living and their own defective education have been hardly in any class at all but for their connexion with uppercross this eldest son of course excepted who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest . the two families had always been on excellent terms there being no pride on one side and no envy on the other and only such a consciousness of superiority in the miss musgroves as made them pleased to improve their cousins . charless attentions to henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation . it would not be a great match for her but if henrietta liked him and henrietta did seem to like him . henrietta fully thought so herself before captain wentworth came but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten . which of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was as yet quite doubtful as far as annes observation reached . henrietta was perhaps the prettiest louisa had the higher spirits and she knew not now whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him . mr and mrs musgrove either from seeing little or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters and of all the young men who came near them seemed to leave everything to take its chance . there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the mansionhouse but it was different at the cottage the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder and captain wentworth had not been above four or five times in the miss musgroves company and charles hayter had but just reappeared when anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister as to which was the one liked best . charles gave it for louisa mary for henrietta but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful . charles had never seen a pleasanter man in his life and from what he had once heard captain wentworth himself say was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war . here was a fortune at once besides which there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war and he was sure captain wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy . oh it would be a capital match for either of his sisters . upon my word it would replied mary . dear me if he should rise to any very great honours if he should ever be made a baronet lady wentworth sounds very well . that would be a noble thing indeed for henrietta she would take place of me then and henrietta would not dislike that . sir frederick and lady wentworth it would be but a new creation however and i never think much of your new creations . it suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred on the very account of charles hayter whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to . she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewedvery sad for herself and her children . you know said she i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made she has no right to throw herself away . i do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them . and pray who is charles hayter nothing but a country curate . a most improper match for miss musgrove of uppercross . her husband however would not agree with her here for besides having a regard for his cousin charles hayter was an eldest son and he saw things as an eldest son himself . now you are taking nonsense mary was therefore his answer . it would not be a great match for henrietta but charles has a very fair chance through the spicers of getting something from the bishop in the course of a year or two and you will please to remember that he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very pretty property . the estate at winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres besides the farm near taunton which is some of the best land in the country . i grant you that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta and indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible but he is a very goodnatured good sort of a fellow and whenever winthrop comes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of it and live in a very different sort of way and with that property he will never be a contemptible mangood freehold property . no no henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter and if she has him and louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisfied . charles may say what he pleases cried mary to anne as soon as he was out of the room but it would be shocking to have henrietta marry charles hayter a very bad thing for her and still worse for me and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt that he has . she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday . i wish you had been there to see her behaviour . and as to captain wentworths liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense to say so for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best . but charles is so positive i wish you had been with us yesterday for then you might have decided between us and i am sure you would have thought as i did unless you had been determined to give it against me . a dinner at mr musgroves had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by anne but she had staid at home under the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return of indisposition in little charles . she had thought only of avoiding captain wentworth but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening . as to captain wentworths views she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honour than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta . either of them would in all probability make him an affectionate goodhumoured wife . with regard to charles hayter she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a wellmeaning young woman and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings the alternation could not be understood too soon . charles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousins behaviour . she had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from uppercross but there was such a change as became very alarming when such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause . he had been absent only two sundays and when they parted had left her interested even to the height of his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy and obtaining that of uppercross instead . it had then seemed the object nearest her heart that dr shirley the rector who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office but was now growing too infirm for many of them should be quite fixed on engaging a curate should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford and should give charles hayter the promise of it . the advantage of his having to come only to uppercross instead of going six miles another way of his having in every respect a better curacy of his belonging to their dear dr shirley and of dear good dr shirleys being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to louisa but had been almost everything to henrietta . when he came back alas the zeal of the business was gone by . louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley she was at a window looking out for captain wentworth and even henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation . well i am very glad indeed but i always thought you would have it i always thought you sure . it did not appear to me thatin short you know dr shirley must have a curate and you had secured his promise . is he coming louisa one morning very soon after the dinner at the musgroves at which anne had not been present captain wentworth walked into the drawingroom at the cottage where were only herself and the little invalid charles who was lying on the sofa . the surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot deprived his manners of their usual composure he started and could only say i thought the miss musgroves had been here mrs musgrove told me i should find them here before he walked to the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave . they are up stairs with my sister they will be down in a few moments i dare say had been annes reply in all the confusion that was natural and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him she would have been out of the room the next moment and released captain wentworth as well as herself . he continued at the window and after calmly and politely saying i hope the little boy is better was silent . she was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain there to satisfy her patient and thus they continued a few minutes when to her very great satisfaction she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule . she hoped on turning her head to see the master of the house but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easycharles hayter probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth than captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne . she only attempted to say how do you do will you not sit down the others will be here presently . captain wentworth however came from his window apparently not illdisposed for conversation but charles hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table and taking up the newspaper and captain wentworth returned to his window . another minute brought another addition . the younger boy a remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door opened for him by some one without made his determined appearance among them and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away . there being nothing to eat he could only have some play and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother he began to fasten himself upon her as she knelt in such a way that busy as she was about charles she could not shake him off . she spoke to him ordered entreated and insisted in vain . once she did contrive to push him away but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly . walter said she get down this moment . you are extremely troublesome . i am very angry with you . walter cried charles hayter why do you not do as you are bid do not you hear your aunt speak come to me walter come to cousin charles . but not a bit did walter stir . in another moment however she found herself in the state of being released from him some one was taking him from her though he had bent down her head so much that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away before she knew that captain wentworth had done it . her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless . she could not even thank him . she could only hang over little charles with most disordered feelings . his kindness in stepping forward to her relief the manner the silence in which it had passed the little particulars of the circumstance with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants produced such a confusion of varying but very painful agitation as she could not recover from till enabled by the entrance of mary and the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares and leave the room . she could not stay . it might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four they were now altogether but she could stay for none of it . it was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards captain wentworth . she had a strong impression of his having said in a vext tone of voice after captain wentworths interference you ought to have minded me walter i told you not to teaze your aunt and could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself . but neither charles hayters feelings nor anybodys feelings could interest her till she had a little better arranged her own . she was ashamed of herself quite ashamed of being so nervous so overcome by such a trifle but so it was and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her . chapter 10 other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur . anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion though too wise to acknowledge as much at home where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife for while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite she could not but think as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience that captain wentworth was not in love with either . they were more in love with him yet there it was not love . it was a little fever of admiration but it might probably must end in love with some . charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted and yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them . anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to . she did not attribute guile to any . it was the highest satisfaction to her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning . there was no triumph no pitiful triumph in his manner . he had probably never heard and never thought of any claims of charles hayter . he was only wrong in accepting the attentions for accepting must be the word of two young women at once . after a short struggle however charles hayter seemed to quit the field . three days had passed without his coming once to uppercross a most decided change . he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner and having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books before him mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right and talked with grave faces of his studying himself to death . it was marys hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from henrietta and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him tomorrow . anne could only feel that charles hayter was wise . one morning about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth being gone ashooting together as the sisters in the cottage were sitting quietly at work they were visited at the window by the sisters from the mansionhouse . it was a very fine november day and the miss musgroves came through the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say that they were going to take a long walk and therefore concluded mary could not like to go with them and when mary immediately replied with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker oh yes i should like to join you very much i am very fond of a long walk anne felt persuaded by the looks of the two girls that it was precisely what they did not wish and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce of everything being to be communicated and everything being to be done together however undesired and inconvenient . she tried to dissuade mary from going but in vain and that being the case thought it best to accept the miss musgroves much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise as she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lessening the interference in any plan of their own . i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk said mary as she went up stairs . everybody is always supposing that i am not a good walker and yet they would not have been pleased if we had refused to join them . when people come in this manner on purpose to ask us how can one say no just as they were setting off the gentlemen returned . they had taken out a young dog who had spoilt their sport and sent them back early . their time and strength and spirits were therefore exactly ready for this walk and they entered into it with pleasure . could anne have foreseen such a junction she would have staid at home but from some feelings of interest and curiosity she fancied now that it was too late to retract and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the miss musgroves who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance . annes object was not to be in the way of anybody and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary to keep with her brother and sister . her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness that season which had drawn from every poet worthy of being read some attempt at description or some lines of feeling . she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations but it was not possible that when within reach of captain wentworths conversation with either of the miss musgroves she should not try to hear it yet she caught little very remarkable . it was mere lively chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing might fall into . he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta . louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister . this distinction appeared to increase and there was one speech of louisas which struck her . after one of the many praises of the day which were continually bursting forth captain wentworth added  what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister they meant to take a long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills . they talked of coming into this side of the country . i wonder whereabouts they will upset today . oh it does happen very often i assure you but my sister makes nothing of it she would as lieve be tossed out as not . ah you make the most of it i know cried louisa but if it were really so i should do just the same in her place . if i loved a man as she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else . it was spoken with enthusiasm . had you cried he catching the same tone i honour you and there was silence between them for a little while . anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again . the sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by unless some tender sonnet fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declining happiness and the images of youth and hope and spring all gone together blessed her memory . she roused herself to say as they struck by order into another path is not this one of the ways to winthrop but nobody heard or at least nobody answered her . winthrop however or its environsfor young men are sometimes to be met with strolling about near homewas their destination and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures where the ploughs at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence and meaning to have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill which parted uppercross and winthrop and soon commanded a full view of the latter at the foot of the hill on the other side . winthrop without beauty and without dignity was stretched before them an indifferent house standing low and hemmed in by the barns and buildings of a farmyard . mary exclaimed bless me here is winthrop . i declare i had no idea well now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired . henrietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin charles walking along any path or leaning against any gate was ready to do as mary wished but no said charles musgrove and no no cried louisa more eagerly and taking her sister aside seemed to be arguing the matter warmly . charles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt now that he was so near and very evidently though more fearfully trying to induce his wife to go too . but this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at winthrop as she felt so tired she resolutely answered oh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good and in short her look and manner declared that go she would not . after a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations it was settled between charles and his two sisters that he and henrietta should just run down for a few minutes to see their aunt and cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill . louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan and as she went a little way with them down the hill still talking to henrietta mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her and saying to captain wentworth it is very unpleasant having such connexions but i assure you i have never been in the house above twice in my life . she received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile followed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which anne perfectly knew the meaning of . the brow of the hill where they remained was a cheerful spot louisa returned and mary finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her but when louisa drew captain wentworth away to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedgerow and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound mary was happy no longer she quarrelled with her own seat was sure louisa had got a much better somewhere and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also . she turned through the same gate but could not see them . anne found a nice seat for her on a dry sunny bank under the hedgerow in which she had no doubt of their still being in some spot or other . mary sat down for a moment but it would not do she was sure louisa had found a better seat somewhere else and she would go on till she overtook her . anne really tired herself was glad to sit down and she very soon heard captain wentworth and louisa in the hedgerow behind her as if making their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the centre . they were speaking as they drew near . louisas voice was the first distinguished . she seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech . what anne first heard was and so i made her go . i could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense . what would i be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right by the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may say no i have no idea of being so easily persuaded . when i have made up my mind i have made it and henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at winthrop today and yet she was as near giving it up out of nonsensical complaisance she would have turned back then but for you she would indeed . i am almost ashamed to say it . happy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand after the hints you gave just now which did but confirm my own observations the last time i was in company with him i need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on . i see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question and woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this . your sister is an amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmness i see . if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can . but this no doubt you have been always doing . it is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on . you are never sure of a good impression being durable everybody may sway it . let those who would be happy be firm . here is a nut said he catching one down from an upper bough . to exemplify a beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength has outlived all the storms of autumn . not a puncture not a weak spot anywhere . this nut he continued with playful solemnity while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of . then returning to his former earnest tone my first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be firm . if louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life she will cherish all her present powers of mind . he had done and was unanswered . it would have surprised anne if louisa could have readily answered such a speech words of such interest spoken with such serious warmth she could imagine what louisa was feeling . for herself she feared to move lest she should be seen . while she remained a bush of low rambling holly protected her and they were moving on . before they were beyond her hearing however louisa spoke again . mary is goodnatured enough in many respects said she but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pridethe elliot pride . she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride . we do so wish that charles had married anne instead . i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne after a moments pause captain wentworth said do you mean that she refused him oh yes certainly . when did that happen i do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time but i believe about a year before he married mary . i wish she had accepted him . we should all have liked her a great deal better and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend lady russells doing that she did not . they think charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell and that therefore she persuaded anne to refuse him . the sounds were retreating and anne distinguished no more . her own emotions still kept her fixed . she had much to recover from before she could move . the listeners proverbial fate was not absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard a great deal of very painful import . she saw how her own character was considered by captain wentworth and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation . as soon as she could she went after mary and having found and walked back with her to their former station by the stile felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected and once more in motion together . her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give . charles and henrietta returned bringing as may be conjectured charles hayter with them . the minutiae of the business anne could not attempt to understand even captain wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentlemans side and a relenting on the ladys and that they were now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt . henrietta looked a little ashamed but very well pleased charles hayter exceedingly happy and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross . everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth nothing could be plainer and where many divisions were necessary or even where they were not they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two . in a long strip of meadow land where there was ample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties and to that party of the three which boasted least animation and least complaisance anne necessarily belonged . she joined charles and mary and was tired enough to be very glad of charless other arm but charles though in very good humour with her was out of temper with his wife . mary had shewn herself disobliging to him and was now to reap the consequence which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch and when mary began to complain of it and lament her being illused according to custom in being on the hedge side while anne was never incommoded on the other he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of and they could hardly get him along at all . this long meadow bordered a lane which their footpath at the end of it was to cross and when the party had all reached the gate of exit the carriage advancing in the same direction which had been some time heard was just coming up and proved to be admiral crofts gig . he and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home . upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired it would save her a full mile and they were going through uppercross . the invitation was general and generally declined . the miss musgroves were not at all tired and mary was either offended by not being asked before any of the others or what louisa called the elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise . the walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting an opposite stile and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again when captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister . the something might be guessed by its effects . miss elliot i am sure you are tired cried mrs croft . do let us have the pleasure of taking you home . here is excellent room for three i assure you . if we were all like you i believe we might sit four . you must indeed you must . anne was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to decline she was not allowed to proceed . the admirals kind urgency came in support of his wifes they would not be refused they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner and captain wentworth without saying a word turned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage . yes he had done it . she was in the carriage and felt that he had placed her there that his will and his hands had done it that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue and his resolution to give her rest . she was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her which all these things made apparent . this little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before . she understood him . he could not forgive her but he could not be unfeeling . though condemning her for the past and considering it with high and unjust resentment though perfectly careless of her and though becoming attached to another still he could not see her suffer without the desire of giving her relief . it was a remainder of former sentiment it was an impulse of pure though unacknowledged friendship it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain that she knew not which prevailed . her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given . they had travelled half their way along the rough lane before she was quite awake to what they said . she then found them talking of frederick . he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls sophy said the admiral but there is no saying which . he has been running after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind . ay this comes of the peace . if it were war now he would have settled it long ago . we sailors miss elliot cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war . how many days was it my dear between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at north yarmouth we had better not talk about it my dear replied mrs croft pleasantly for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together . i had known you by character however long before . well and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we to wait for besides i do not like having such things so long in hand . i wish frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home one of these young ladies to kellynch . then there would always be company for them . and very nice young ladies they both are i hardly know one from the other . very good humoured unaffected girls indeed said mrs croft in a tone of calmer praise such as made anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother and a very respectable family . one could not be connected with better people . my dear admiral that post we shall certainly take that post . but by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut nor ran foul of a dungcart and anne with some amusement at their style of driving which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage . chapter 11 the time now approached for lady russells return the day was even fixed and anne being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled was looking forward to an early removal to kellynch and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it . it would place her in the same village with captain wentworth within half a mile of him they would have to frequent the same church and there must be intercourse between the two families . this was against her but on the other hand he spent so much of his time at uppercross that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind than as going towards him and upon the whole she believed she must on this interesting question be the gainer almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society in leaving poor mary for lady russell . she wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing captain wentworth at the hall those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and captain wentworth never meeting anywhere . they did not like each other and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were lady russell to see them together she might think that he had too much selfpossession and she too little . these points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from uppercross where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough . her usefulness to little charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months visit there but he was gaining strength apace and she had nothing else to stay for . the conclusion of her visit however was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined . captain wentworth after being unseen and unheard of at uppercross for two whole days appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away . a letter from his friend captain harville having found him out at last had brought intelligence of captain harvilles being settled with his family at lyme for the winter of their being therefore quite unknowingly within twenty miles of each other . captain harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before and captain wentworths anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to lyme . he had been there for fourandtwenty hours . his acquittal was complete his friendship warmly honoured a lively interest excited for his friend and his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to by the party that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves and a project for going thither was the consequence . the young people were all wild to see lyme . captain wentworth talked of going there again himself it was only seventeen miles from uppercross though november the weather was by no means bad and in short louisa who was the most eager of the eager having formed the resolution to go and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer and to lyme they were to gocharles mary anne henrietta louisa and captain wentworth . the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night but to this mr musgrove for the sake of his horses would not consent and when it came to be rationally considered a day in the middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place after deducting seven hours as the nature of the country required for going and returning . they were consequently to stay the night there and not to be expected back till the next days dinner . this was felt to be a considerable amendment and though they all met at the great house at rather an early breakfast hour and set off very punctually it was so much past noon before the two carriages mr musgroves coach containing the four ladies and charless curricle in which he drove captain wentworth were descending the long hill into lyme and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them before the light and warmth of the day were gone . after securing accommodations and ordering a dinner at one of the inns the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea . they were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which lyme as a public place might offer . the rooms were shut up the lodgers almost all gone scarcely any family but of the residents left and as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves the remarkable situation of the town the principal street almost hurrying into the water the walk to the cobb skirting round the pleasant little bay which in the season is animated with bathing machines and company the cobb itself its old wonders and new improvements with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town are what the strangers eye will seek and a very strange stranger it must be who does not see charms in the immediate environs of lyme to make him wish to know it better . the scenes in its neighbourhood charmouth with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country and still more its sweet retired bay backed by dark cliffs where fragments of low rock among the sands make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide for sitting in unwearied contemplation the woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme and above all pinny with its green chasms between romantic rocks where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the farfamed isle of wight these places must be visited and visited again to make the worth of lyme understood . the party from uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms and still descending soon found themselves on the seashore and lingering only as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea who ever deserved to look on it at all proceeded towards the cobb equally their object in itself and on captain wentworths account for in a small house near the foot of an old pier of unknown date were the harvilles settled . captain wentworth turned in to call on his friend the others walked on and he was to join them on the cobb . they were by no means tired of wondering and admiring and not even louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long when they saw him coming after them with three companions all well known already by description to be captain and mrs harville and a captain benwick who was staying with them . captain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia and the account which captain wentworth had given of him on his return from lyme before his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer whom he had always valued highly which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener had been followed by a little history of his private life which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies . he had been engaged to captain harvilles sister and was now mourning her loss . they had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion . fortune came his prizemoney as lieutenant being great promotion too came at last but fanny harville did not live to know it . she had died the preceding summer while he was at sea . captain wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor benwick had been to fanny harville or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change . he considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily uniting very strong feelings with quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for reading and sedentary pursuits . to finish the interest of the story the friendship between him and the harvilles seemed if possible augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance and captain benwick was now living with them entirely . captain harville had taken his present house for half a year his taste and his health and his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpensive and by the sea and the grandeur of the country and the retirement of lyme in the winter appeared exactly adapted to captain benwicks state of mind . the sympathy and goodwill excited towards captain benwick was very great . and yet said anne to herself as they now moved forward to meet the party he has not perhaps a more sorrowing heart than i have . i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever . he is younger than i am younger in feeling if not in fact younger as a man . he will rally again and be happy with another . they all met and were introduced . captain harville was a tall dark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame and from strong features and want of health looking much older than captain wentworth . captain benwick looked and was the youngest of the three and compared with either of them a little man . he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air just as he ought to have and drew back from conversation . captain harville though not equalling captain wentworth in manners was a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging . mrs harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed however to have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own because the friends of captain wentworth or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them . the dinner already ordered at the inn was at last though unwillingly accepted as a excuse but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth should have brought any such party to lyme without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them . there was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon so unlike the usual style of giveandtake invitations and dinners of formality and display that anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brotherofficers . these would have been all my friends was her thought and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness . on quitting the cobb they all went indoors with their new friends and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many . anne had a moments astonishment on the subject herself but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville to turn the actual space to the best account to supply the deficiencies of lodginghouse furniture and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected . the varieties in the fittingup of the rooms where the common necessaries provided by the owner in the common indifferent plight were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood excellently worked up and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries captain harville had visited were more than amusing to anne connected as it all was with his profession the fruit of its labours the effect of its influence on his habits the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented made it to her a something more or less than gratification . captain harville was no reader but he had contrived excellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves for a tolerable collection of wellbound volumes the property of captain benwick . his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within . he drew he varnished he carpentered he glued he made toys for the children he fashioned new nettingneedles and pins with improvements and if everything else was done sat down to his large fishingnet at one corner of the room . anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house and louisa by whom she found herself walking burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy their friendliness their brotherliness their openness their uprightness protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england that they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be respected and loved . they went back to dress and dine and so well had the scheme answered already that nothing was found amiss though its being so entirely out of season and the no thoroughfare of lyme and the no expectation of company had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn . anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in captain wentworths company than she had at first imagined could ever be that the sitting down to the same table with him now and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it they never got beyond was become a mere nothing . the nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening and he came bringing his friend also which was more than had been expected it having been agreed that captain benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers . he ventured among them again however though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general . while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room and by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others it fell to annes lot to be placed rather apart with captain benwick and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him . he was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of her countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect and anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion . he was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading though principally in poetry and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evenings indulgence in the discussion of subjects which his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction which had naturally grown out of their conversation . for though shy he did not seem reserved it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints and having talked of poetry the richness of the present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the firstrate poets trying to ascertain whether marmion or the lady of the lake were to be preferred and how ranked the giaour and the bride of abydos and moreover how the giaour was to be pronounced he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other he repeated with such tremulous feeling the various lines which imaged a broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry and to say that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly . his looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion to his situation she was emboldened to go on and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study and on being requested to particularize mentioned such works of our best moralists such collections of the finest letters such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances . captain benwick listened attentively and seemed grateful for the interest implied and though with a shake of the head and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his noted down the names of those she recommended and promised to procure and read them . when the evening was over anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before nor could she help fearing on more serious reflection that like many other great moralists and preachers she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination . chapter 12 anne and henrietta finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast . they went to the sands to watch the flowing of the tide which a fine southeasterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted . they praised the morning gloried in the sea sympathized in the delight of the freshfeeling breezeand were silent till henrietta suddenly began again with oh yesi am quite convinced that with very few exceptions the seaair always does good . there can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to dr shirley after his illness last spring twelvemonth . he declares himself that coming to lyme for a month did him more good than all the medicine he took and that being by the sea always makes him feel young again . now i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea . i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely and fix at lyme . do not you anne do not you agree with me that it is the best thing he could do both for himself and mrs shirley she has cousins here you know and many acquaintance which would make it cheerful for her and i am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand in case of his having another seizure . indeed i think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley who have been doing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a place like uppercross where excepting our family they seem shut out from all the world . i wish his friends would propose it to him . i really think they ought . and as to procuring a dispensation there could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character . my only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish . he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions overscrupulous i must say . do not you think anne it is being overscrupulous do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties which may be just as well performed by another person and at lyme too only seventeen miles off he would be near enough to hear if people thought there was anything to complain of . anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech and entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good of a lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business felt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man as a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curates being married . i wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion i wish lady russell lived at uppercross and were intimate with dr shirley . i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody i always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything i am afraid of her as i have told you before quite afraid of her because she is so very clever but i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour at uppercross . anne was amused by henriettas manner of being grateful and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of henriettas views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the musgrove family she had only time however for a general answer and a wish that such another woman were at uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceased on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them . they came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready but louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town . they were all at her disposal . when they came to the steps leading upwards from the beach a gentleman at the same moment preparing to come down politely drew back and stopped to give them way . they ascended and passed him and as they passed annes face caught his eye and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of . she was looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty features having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye which it had also produced . it was evident that the gentleman completely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly . captain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it . he gave her a momentary glance a glance of brightness which seemed to say that man is struck with you and even i at this moment see something like anne elliot again . after attending louisa through her business and loitering about a little longer they returned to the inn and anne in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their diningroom had nearly run against the very same gentleman as he came out of an adjoining apartment . she had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves and determined that a welllooking groom who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back should be his servant . both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea . it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves and this second meeting short as it was also proved again by the gentlemans looks that he thought hers very lovely and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies that he was a man of exceedingly good manners . he seemed about thirty and though not handsome had an agreeable person . anne felt that she should like to know who he was . they had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage almost the first they had heard since entering lyme drew half the party to the window . it was a gentlemans carriage a curricle but only coming round from the stableyard to the front door somebody must be going away . it was driven by a servant in mourning . the word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own the servant in mourning roused annes curiosity and the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household and taking his seat to drive off . ah cried captain wentworth instantly and with half a glance at anne it is the very man we passed . the miss musgroves agreed to it and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast table . the waiter came into the room soon afterwards . pray said captain wentworth immediately can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away yes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night from sidmouth . dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were at dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath and london . elliot many had looked on each other and many had repeated the name before all this had been got through even by the smart rapidity of a waiter . bless me cried mary it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot it must indeed charles anne must not it in mourning you see just as our mr elliot must be . how very extraordinary in the very same inn with us anne must not it be our mr elliot my fathers next heir pray sir turning to the waiter did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch family no maam he did not mention no particular family but he said his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day . there you see cried mary in an ecstasy just as i said heir to sir walter elliot i was sure that would come out if it was so . depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish wherever he goes . but anne only conceive how extraordinary i wish i had looked at him more . i wish we had been aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us . what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other do you think he had the elliot countenance i hardly looked at him i was looking at the horses but i think he had something of the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me oh the greatcoat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms so it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them and the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning one should have known him by the livery . putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together said captain wentworth we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin . when she could command marys attention anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and mr elliot had not for many years been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable . at the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense . she would not upon any account mention her having met with him the second time luckily mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk but she would have felt quite illused by annes having actually run against him in the passage and received his very polite excuses while she had never been near him at all no that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret . of course said mary you will mention our seeing mr elliot the next time you write to bath . i think my father certainly ought to hear of it do mention all about him . anne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated but as what ought to be suppressed . the offence which had been given her father many years back she knew elizabeths particular share in it she suspected and that mr elliots idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt . mary never wrote to bath herself all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth fell on anne . breakfast had not been long over when they were joined by captain and mrs harville and captain benwick with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about lyme . they ought to be setting off for uppercross by one and in the mean while were to be all together and out of doors as long as they could . anne found captain benwick getting near her as soon as they were all fairly in the street . their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again and they walked together some time talking as before of mr scott and lord byron and still as unable as before and as unable as any other two readers to think exactly alike of the merits of either till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party and instead of captain benwick she had captain harville by her side . miss elliot said he speaking rather low you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much . i wish he could have such company oftener . it is bad for him i know to be shut up as he is but what can we do we cannot part . no said anne that i can easily believe to be impossible but in time perhapswe know what time does in every case of affliction and you must remember captain harville that your friend may yet be called a young mourneronly last summer i understand . ay true enough with a deep sigh only june . and not known to him perhaps so soon . not till the first week of august when he came home from the cape just made into the grappler . i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him he sent in letters but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth . there the news must follow him but who was to tell it not i .  i would as soon have been run up to the yardarm . nobody could do it but that good fellow pointing to captain wentworth . the laconia had come into plymouth the week before no danger of her being sent to sea again . he stood his chance for the rest wrote up for leave of absence but without waiting the return travelled night and day till he got to portsmouth rowed off to the grappler that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week . thats what he did and nobody else could have saved poor james . you may think miss elliot whether he is dear to us anne did think on the question with perfect decision and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish or as his seemed able to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject and when he spoke again it was of something totally different . mrs harvilles giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk they would accompany them to their door and then return and set off themselves . by all their calculations there was just time for this but as they drew near the cobb there was such a general wish to walk along it once more all were so inclined and louisa soon grew so determined that the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found would be no difference at all so with all the kind leavetaking and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined they parted from captain and mrs harville at their own door and still accompanied by captain benwick who seemed to cling to them to the last proceeded to make the proper adieus to the cobb . anne found captain benwick again drawing near her . lord byrons dark blue seas could not fail of being brought forward by their present view and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible . it was soon drawn perforce another way . there was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant for the ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight excepting louisa she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth . in all their walks he had had to jump her from the stiles the sensation was delightful to her . the hardness of the pavement for her feet made him less willing upon the present occasion he did it however . she was safely down and instantly to show her enjoyment ran up the steps to be jumped down again . he advised her against it thought the jar too great but no he reasoned and talked in vain she smiled and said i am determined i will he put out his hands she was too precipitate by half a second she fell on the pavement on the lower cobb and was taken up lifeless there was no wound no blood no visible bruise but her eyes were closed she breathed not her face was like death . the horror of the moment to all who stood around captain wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her in his arms looking on her with a face as pallid as her own in an agony of silence . she is dead she is dead screamed mary catching hold of her husband and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable and in another moment henrietta sinking under the conviction lost her senses too and would have fallen on the steps but for captain benwick and anne who caught and supported her between them . is there no one to help me were the first words which burst from captain wentworth in a tone of despair and as if all his own strength were gone . go to him go to him cried anne for heavens sake go to him . i can support her myself . leave me and go to him . rub her hands rub her temples here are salts take them take them . captain benwick obeyed and charles at the same moment disengaging himself from his wife they were both with him and louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them and everything was done that anne had prompted but in vain while captain wentworth staggering against the wall for his support exclaimed in the bitterest agony oh god her father and mother a surgeon said anne . he caught the word it seemed to rouse him at once and saying only true true a surgeon this instant was darting away when anne eagerly suggested captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick he knows where a surgeon is to be found . every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea and in a moment it was all done in rapid moments captain benwick had resigned the poor corpselike figure entirely to the brothers care and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity . as to the wretched party left behind it could scarcely be said which of the three who were completely rational was suffering most captain wentworth anne or charles who really a very affectionate brother hung over louisa with sobs of grief and could only turn his eyes from one sister to see the other in a state as insensible or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife calling on him for help which he could not give . anne attending with all the strength and zeal and thought which instinct supplied to henrietta still tried at intervals to suggest comfort to the others tried to quiet mary to animate charles to assuage the feelings of captain wentworth . both seemed to look to her for directions . anne anne cried charles what is to be done next what in heavens name is to be done next captain wentworths eyes were also turned towards her . had not she better be carried to the inn yes i am sure carry her gently to the inn . yes yes to the inn repeated captain wentworth comparatively collected and eager to be doing something . i will carry her myself . musgrove take care of the others . by this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the cobb and many were collected near them to be useful if wanted at any rate to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fine as the first report . to some of the bestlooking of these good people henrietta was consigned for though partially revived she was quite helpless and in this manner anne walking by her side and charles attending to his wife they set forward treading back with feelings unutterable the ground which so lately so very lately and so light of heart they had passed along . they were not off the cobb before the harvilles met them . captain benwick had been seen flying by their house with a countenance which showed something to be wrong and they had set off immediately informed and directed as they passed towards the spot . shocked as captain harville was he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done . she must be taken to their house all must go to their house and await the surgeons arrival there . they would not listen to scruples he was obeyed they were all beneath his roof and while louisa under mrs harvilles direction was conveyed up stairs and given possession of her own bed assistance cordials restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them . louisa had once opened her eyes but soon closed them again without apparent consciousness . this had been a proof of life however of service to her sister and henrietta though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with louisa was kept by the agitation of hope and fear from a return of her own insensibility . mary too was growing calmer . the surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible . they were sick with horror while he examined but he was not hopeless . the head had received a severe contusion but he had seen greater injuries recovered from he was by no means hopeless he spoke cheerfully . that he did not regard it as a desperate case that he did not say a few hours must end it was at first felt beyond the hope of most and the ecstasy of such a reprieve the rejoicing deep and silent after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered may be conceived . the tone the look with which thank god was uttered by captain wentworth anne was sure could never be forgotten by her nor the sight of him afterwards as he sat near a table leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them . louisas limbs had escaped . there was no injury but to the head . it now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done as to their general situation . they were now able to speak to each other and consult . that louisa must remain where she was however distressing to her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble did not admit a doubt . her removal was impossible . the harvilles silenced all scruples and as much as they could all gratitude . they had looked forward and arranged everything before the others began to reflect . captain benwick must give up his room to them and get another bed elsewhere and the whole was settled . they were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more and yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maids room or swinging a cot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish to stay though with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harvilles care entirely . mrs harville was a very experienced nurse and her nurserymaid who had lived with her long and gone about with her everywhere was just such another . between these two she could want no possible attendance by day or night . and all this was said with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible . charles henrietta and captain wentworth were the three in consultation and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror . uppercross the necessity of some ones going to uppercross the news to be conveyed how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove the lateness of the morning an hour already gone since they ought to have been off the impossibility of being in tolerable time . at first they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations but after a while captain wentworth exerting himself said we must be decided and without the loss of another minute . every minute is valuable . some one must resolve on being off for uppercross instantly . musgrove either you or i must go . charles agreed but declared his resolution of not going away . he would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville but as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor would . so far it was decided and henrietta at first declared the same . she however was soon persuaded to think differently . the usefulness of her staying she who had not been able to remain in louisas room or to look at her without sufferings which made her worse than helpless she was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good yet was still unwilling to be away till touched by the thought of her father and mother she gave it up she consented she was anxious to be at home . the plan had reached this point when anne coming quietly down from louisas room could not but hear what followed for the parlour door was open . then it is settled musgrove cried captain wentworth that you stay and that i take care of your sister home . but as to the rest as to the others if one stays to assist mrs harville i think it need be only one . mrs charles musgrove will of course wish to get back to her children but if anne will stay no one so proper so capable as anne . she paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of . the other two warmly agreed with what he said and she then appeared . you will stay i am sure you will stay and nurse her cried he turning to her and speaking with a glow and yet a gentleness which seemed almost restoring the past . she coloured deeply and he recollected himself and moved away . she expressed herself most willing ready happy to remain . it was what she had been thinking of and wishing to be allowed to do . a bed on the floor in louisas room would be sufficient for her if mrs harville would but think so . one thing more and all seemed arranged . though it was rather desirable that mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay yet the time required by the uppercross horses to take them back would be a dreadful extension of suspense and captain wentworth proposed and charles musgrove agreed that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn and leave mr musgroves carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of louisas night . captain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part and to be soon followed by the two ladies . when the plan was made known to mary however there was an end of all peace in it . she was so wretched and so vehement complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of anne anne who was nothing to louisa while she was her sister and had the best right to stay in henriettas stead why was not she to be as useful as anne and to go home without charles too without her husband no it was too unkind . and in short she said more than her husband could long withstand and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way there was no help for it the change of mary for anne was inevitable . anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and illjudging claims of mary but so it must be and they set off for the town charles taking care of his sister and captain benwick attending to her . she gave a moments recollection as they hurried along to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning . there she had listened to henriettas schemes for dr shirleys leaving uppercross farther on she had first seen mr elliot a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but louisa or those who were wrapt up in her welfare . captain benwick was most considerately attentive to her and united as they all seemed by the distress of the day she felt an increasing degree of goodwill towards him and a pleasure even in thinking that it might perhaps be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance . captain wentworth was on the watch for them and a chaise and four in waiting stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other the change in his countenance the astonishment the expressions begun and suppressed with which charles was listened to made but a mortifying reception of anne or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa . she endeavoured to be composed and to be just . without emulating the feelings of an emma towards her henry she would have attended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard for his sake and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend . in the mean while she was in the carriage . he had handed them both in and placed himself between them and in this manner under these circumstances full of astonishment and emotion to anne she quitted lyme . how the long stage would pass how it was to affect their manners what was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee . it was all quite natural however . he was devoted to henrietta always turning towards her and when he spoke at all always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits . in general his voice and manner were studiously calm . to spare henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle . once only when she had been grieving over the last illjudged illfated walk to the cobb bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of he burst forth as if wholly overcome dont talk of it dont talk of it he cried . oh god that i had not given way to her at the fatal moment had i done as i ought but so eager and so resolute dear sweet louisa anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character and whether it might not strike him that like all other qualities of the mind it should have its proportions and limits . she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character . they got on fast . anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon . their actual speed heightened by some dread of the conclusion made the road appear but half as long as on the day before . it was growing quite dusk however before they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross and there had been total silence among them for some time henrietta leaning back in the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep when as they were going up their last hill anne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth . in a low cautious voice he said  i have been considering what we had best do . she must not appear at first . she could not stand it . i have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her while i go in and break it to mr and mrs musgrove . do you think this is a good plan she did he was satisfied and said no more . but the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship and of deference for her judgement a great pleasure and when it became a sort of parting proof its value did not lessen . when the distressing communication at uppercross was over and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped and the daughter all the better for being with them he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to lyme and when the horses were baited he was off . end of volume one . chapter 13 the remainder of annes time at uppercross comprehending only two days was spent entirely at the mansion house and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there both as an immediate companion and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future which in mr and mrs musgroves distressed state of spirits would have been difficulties . they had an early account from lyme the next morning . louisa was much the same . no symptoms worse than before had appeared . charles came a few hours afterwards to bring a later and more particular account . he was tolerably cheerful . a speedy cure must not be hoped but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted . in speaking of the harvilles he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness especially of mrs harvilles exertions as a nurse . she really left nothing for mary to do . he and mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night . mary had been hysterical again this morning . when he came away she was going to walk out with captain benwick which he hoped would do her good . he almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before but the truth was that mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do . charles was to return to lyme the same afternoon and his father had at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent . it would be going only to multiply trouble to the others and increase his own distress and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon . a chaise was sent for from crewkherne and charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nurserymaid of the family one who having brought up all the children and seen the very last the lingering and longpetted master harry sent to school after his brothers was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her and who consequently was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa . vague wishes of getting sarah thither had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henrietta but without anne it would hardly have been resolved on and found practicable so soon . they were indebted the next day to charles hayter for all the minute knowledge of louisa which it was so essential to obtain every twentyfour hours . he made it his business to go to lyme and his account was still encouraging . the intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger . every report agreed in captain wentworths appearing fixed in lyme . anne was to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreaded . what should they do without her they were wretched comforters for one another . and so much was said in this way that anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once . she had little difficulty it was soon determined that they would go go tomorrow fix themselves at the inn or get into lodgings as it suited and there remain till dear louisa could be moved . they must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with they might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children and in short they were so happy in the decision that anne was delighted with what she had done and felt that she could not spend her last morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations and sending them off at an early hour though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence . she was the last excepting the little boys at the cottage she was the very last the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses of all that had given uppercross its cheerful character . a few days had made a change indeed if louisa recovered it would all be well again . more than former happiness would be restored . there could not be a doubt to her mind there was none of what would follow her recovery . a few months hence and the room now so deserted occupied but by her silent pensive self might be filled again with all that was happy and gay all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love all that was most unlike anne elliot an hours complete leisure for such reflections as these on a dark november day a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows was enough to make the sound of lady russells carriage exceedingly welcome and yet though desirous to be gone she could not quit the mansion house or look an adieu to the cottage with its black dripping and comfortless veranda or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village without a saddened heart . scenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious . it stood the record of many sensations of pain once severe but now softened and of some instances of relenting feeling some breathings of friendship and reconciliation which could never be looked for again and which could never cease to be dear . she left it all behind her all but the recollection that such things had been . anne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russells house in september . it had not been necessary and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade and escape from . her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the lodge and to gladden the eyes of its mistress . there was some anxiety mixed with lady russells joy in meeting her . she knew who had been frequenting uppercross . but happily either anne was improved in plumpness and looks or lady russell fancied her so and anne in receiving her compliments on the occasion had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty . when they came to converse she was soon sensible of some mental change . the subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch and which she had felt slighted and been compelled to smother among the musgroves were now become but of secondary interest . she had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath . their concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place which had been taken and her regret that mrs clay should still be with them anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove and all her acquaintance there how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick than her own fathers house in camden place or her own sisters intimacy with mrs clay . she was actually forced to exert herself to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude on topics which had by nature the first claim on her . there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject . they must speak of the accident at lyme . lady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before when a full account of the whole had burst on her but still it must be talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the imprudence lament the result and captain wentworths name must be mentioned by both . anne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell . she could not speak the name and look straight forward to lady russells eye till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa . when this was told his name distressed her no longer . lady russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in pleased contempt that the man who at twentythree had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an anne elliot should eight years afterwards be charmed by a louisa musgrove . the first three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme which found their way to anne she could not tell how and brought a rather improving account of louisa . at the end of that period lady russells politeness could repose no longer and the fainter selfthreatenings of the past became in a decided tone i must call on mrs croft i really must call upon her soon . anne have you courage to go with me and pay a visit in that house it will be some trial to us both . anne did not shrink from it on the contrary she truly felt as she said in observing i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine . by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it . she could have said more on the subject for she had in fact so high an opinion of the crofts and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants felt the parish to be so sure of a good example and the poor of the best attention and relief that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay and that kellynch hall had passed into better hands than its owners . these convictions must unquestionably have their own pain and severe was its kind but they precluded that pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again and returning through the wellknown apartments . in such moments anne had no power of saying to herself these rooms ought to belong only to us . oh how fallen in their destination how unworthily occupied an ancient family to be so driven away strangers filling their place no except when she thought of her mother and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that description to heave . mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion receiving her in that house there was particular attention . the sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday the first time since the accident had brought anne the last note which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of had staid a few hours and then returned again to lyme and without any present intention of quitting it any more . he had enquired after her she found particularly had expressed his hope of miss elliots not being the worse for her exertions and had spoken of those exertions as great . this was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done . as to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady sensible women whose judgements had to work on ascertained events and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence that its effects were most alarming and that it was frightful to think how long miss musgroves recovery might yet be doubtful and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter the admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming ay a very bad business indeed . a new sort of way this for a young fellow to be making love by breaking his mistresss head is not it miss elliot this is breaking a head and giving a plaster truly admiral crofts manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell but they delighted anne . his goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible . now this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing from a little reverie to be coming and finding us here . i had not recollected it before i declare but it must be very bad . but now do not stand upon ceremony . get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it . another time sir i thank you not now . well whenever it suits you . you can slip in from the shrubbery at any time and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door . a good place is not it but checking himself you will not think it a good place for yours were always kept in the butlers room . ay so it always is i believe . one mans ways may be as good as anothers but we all like our own best . and so you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not . anne finding she might decline it did so very gratefully . we have made very few changes either continued the admiral after thinking a moment . very few . we told you about the laundrydoor at uppercross . that has been a very great improvement . the wonder was how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did so long you will tell sir walter what we have done and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had . indeed i must do ourselves the justice to say that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better . my wife should have the credit of them however . i have done very little besides sending away some of the large lookingglasses from my dressingroom which was your fathers . a very good man and very much the gentleman i am sure but i should think miss elliot looking with serious reflection i should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life . such a number of lookingglasses oh lord there was no getting away from ones self . so i got sophy to lend me a hand and we soon shifted their quarters and now i am quite snug with my little shaving glass in one corner and another great thing that i never go near . anne amused in spite of herself was rather distressed for an answer and the admiral fearing he might not have been civil enough took up the subject again to say the next time you write to your good father miss elliot pray give him my compliments and mrs crofts and say that we are settled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find with the place . the breakfastroom chimney smokes a little i grant you but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard which may not happen three times a winter . and take it altogether now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge there is not one that we like better than this . pray say so with my compliments . he will be glad to hear it . lady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present for when it was returned the crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks to visit their connexions in the north of the county and probably might not be at home again before lady russell would be removing to bath . so ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall or of seeing him in company with her friend . everything was safe enough and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject . chapter 14 though charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after mr and mrs musgroves going than anne conceived they could have been at all wanted they were yet the first of the family to be at home again and as soon as possible after their return to uppercross they drove over to the lodge . they had left louisa beginning to sit up but her head though clear was exceedingly weak and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home and her father and mother who must return in time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them . they had been all in lodgings together . mrs musgrove had got mrs harvilles children away as much as she could every possible supply from uppercross had been furnished to lighten the inconvenience to the harvilles while the harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day and in short it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable . mary had had her evils but upon the whole as was evident by her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to suffer . charles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her and when they dined with the harvilles there had been only a maidservant to wait and at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence but then she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was and there had been so much going on every day there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the harvilles and she had got books from the library and changed them so often that the balance had certainly been much in favour of lyme . she had been taken to charmouth too and she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross and all this joined to the sense of being so very useful had made really an agreeable fortnight . anne enquired after captain benwick marys face was clouded directly . charles laughed . oh captain benwick is very well i believe but he is a very odd young man . i do not know what he would be at . we asked him to come home with us for a day or two charles undertook to give him some shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my part i thought it was all settled when behold on tuesday night he made a very awkward sort of excuse he never shot and he had been quite misunderstood and he had promised this and he had promised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to come . i suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my word i should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage for such a heartbroken man as captain benwick . charles laughed again and said now mary you know very well how it really was . it was all your doing turning to anne . he fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by he fancied everybody to be living in uppercross and when he discovered that lady russell lived three miles off his heart failed him and he had not courage to come . that is the fact upon my honour mary knows it is . but mary did not give into it very graciously whether from not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an elliot or from not wanting to believe anne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself must be left to be guessed . annes goodwill however was not to be lessened by what she heard . she boldly acknowledged herself flattered and continued her enquiries . oh he talks of you cried charles in such terms mary interrupted him . i declare charles i never heard him mention anne twice all the time i was there . i declare anne he never talks of you at all . no admitted charles i do not know that he ever does in a general way but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly . his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation and he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinksoh i cannot pretend to remember it but it was something very finei overheard him telling henrietta all about it and then miss elliot was spoken of in the highest terms now mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you were in the other room . elegance sweetness beauty . oh there was no end of miss elliots charms . and i am sure cried mary warmly it was a very little to his credit if he did . miss harville only died last june . such a heart is very little worth having is it lady russell i am sure you will agree with me . i must see captain benwick before i decide said lady russell smiling . and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you maam said charles . though he had not nerves for coming away with us and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself you may depend on it . i told him the distance and the road and i told him of the churchs being so very well worth seeing for as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would be a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon . so i give you notice lady russell . any acquaintance of annes will always be welcome to me was lady russells kind answer . oh as to being annes acquaintance said mary i think he is rather my acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight . well as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy to see captain benwick . you will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you maam . he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived . he has walked with me sometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word . he is not at all a wellbred young man . i am sure you will not like him . there we differ mary said anne . i think lady russell would like him . i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner . so do i anne said charles . i am sure lady russell would like him . he is just lady russells sort . give him a book and he will read all day long . yes that he will exclaimed mary tauntingly . he will sit poring over his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one drops ones scissors or anything that happens . do you think lady russell would like that lady russell could not help laughing . upon my word said she i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact as i may call myself . i have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions . i wish he may be induced to call here . and when he does mary you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined not to judge him beforehand . you will not like him i will answer for it . lady russell began talking of something else . mary spoke with animation of their meeting with or rather missing mr elliot so extraordinarily . he is a man said lady russell whom i have no wish to see . his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me . this decision checked marys eagerness and stopped her short in the midst of the elliot countenance . with regard to captain wentworth though anne hazarded no enquiries there was voluntary communication sufficient . his spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected . as louisa improved he had improved and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week . he had not seen louisa and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview that he did not press for it at all and on the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days till her head was stronger . he had talked of going down to plymouth for a week and wanted to persuade captain benwick to go with him but as charles maintained to the last captain benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch . there can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both occasionally thinking of captain benwick from this time . lady russell could not hear the doorbell without feeling that it might be his herald nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her fathers grounds or any visit of charity in the village without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him . captain benwick came not however . he was either less disposed for it than charles had imagined or he was too shy and after giving him a weeks indulgence lady russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite . the musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school bringing with them mrs harvilles little children to improve the noise of uppercross and lessen that of lyme . henrietta remained with louisa but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters . lady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once when anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again . though neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles hayter nor captain wentworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in . immediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the cottage expressly arrived to amuse them . on one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk and gold paper and on the other were tressels and trays bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies where riotous boys were holding high revel the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire which seemed determined to be heard in spite of all the noise of the others . charles and mary also came in of course during their visit and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respects to lady russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes talking with a very raised voice but from the clamour of the children on his knees generally in vain . it was a fine familypiece . anne judging from her own temperament would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves which louisas illness must have so greatly shaken . but mrs musgrove who got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially again and again for all her attentions to them concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing with a happy glance round the room that after all she had gone through nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home . louisa was now recovering apace . her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home before her brothers and sisters went to school again . the harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at uppercross whenever she returned . captain wentworth was gone for the present to see his brother in shropshire . i hope i shall remember in future said lady russell as soon as they were reseated in the carriage not to call at uppercross in the christmas holidays . everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters and sounds are quite innoxious or most distressing by their sort rather than their quantity . when lady russell not long afterwards was entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving through the long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place amidst the dash of other carriages the heavy rumble of carts and drays the bawling of newspapermen muffinmen and milkmen and the ceaseless clink of pattens she made no complaint . no these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures her spirits rose under their influence and like mrs musgrove she was feeling though not saying that after being long in the country nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness . anne did not share these feelings . she persisted in a very determined though very silent disinclination for bath caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings smoking in rain without any wish of seeing them better felt their progress through the streets to be however disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad to see her when she arrived and looked back with fond regret to the bustles of uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch . elizabeths last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest . mr elliot was in bath . he had called in camden place had called a second time a third had been pointedly attentive . if elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect . this was very wonderful if it were true and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about mr elliot already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to mary of his being a man whom she had no wish to see . she had a great wish to see him . if he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree . anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance but she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not which was more than she could say for many other persons in bath . she was put down in camden place and lady russell then drove to her own lodgings in rivers street . chapter 15 sir walter had taken a very good house in camden place a lofty dignified situation such as becomes a man of consequence and both he and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction . anne entered it with a sinking heart anticipating an imprisonment of many months and anxiously saying to herself oh when shall i leave you again a degree of unexpected cordiality however in the welcome she received did her good . her father and sister were glad to see her for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture and met her with kindness . her making a fourth when they sat down to dinner was noticed as an advantage . mrs clay was very pleasant and very smiling but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course . anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for . they were evidently in excellent spirits and she was soon to listen to the causes . they had no inclination to listen to her . after laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which anne could not pay they had only a few faint enquiries to make before the talk must be all their own . uppercross excited no interest kellynch very little it was all bath . they had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered their expectations in every respect . their house was undoubtedly the best in camden place their drawingrooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of and the superiority was not less in the style of the fittingup or the taste of the furniture . their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after . everybody was wanting to visit them . they had drawn back from many introductions and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing . here were funds of enjoyment . could anne wonder that her father and sister were happy she might not wonder but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town and she must sigh and smile and wonder too as elizabeth threw open the foldingdoors and walked with exultation from one drawingroom to the other boasting of their space at the possibility of that woman who had been mistress of kellynch hall finding extent to be proud of between two walls perhaps thirty feet asunder . but this was not all which they had to make them happy . they had mr elliot too . anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot . he was not only pardoned they were delighted with him . he had been in bath about a fortnight he had passed through bath in november in his way to london when the intelligence of sir walters being settled there had of course reached him though only twentyfour hours in the place but he had not been able to avail himself of it but he had now been a fortnight in bath and his first object on arriving had been to leave his card in camden place following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet and when they did meet by such great openness of conduct such readiness to apologize for the past such solicitude to be received as a relation again that their former good understanding was completely reestablished . they had not a fault to find in him . he had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side . it had originated in misapprehension entirely . he had never had an idea of throwing himself off he had feared that he was thrown off but knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent . upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours he was quite indignant . he who had ever boasted of being an elliot and whose feelings as to connection were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day . he was astonished indeed but his character and general conduct must refute it . he could refer sir walter to all who knew him and certainly the pains he had been taking on this the first opportunity of reconciliation to be restored to the footing of a relation and heirpresumptive was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject . the circumstances of his marriage too were found to admit of much extenuation . this was an article not to be entered on by himself but a very intimate friend of his a colonel wallis a highly respectable man perfectly the gentleman and not an illlooking man sir walter added who was living in very good style in marlborough buildings and had at his own particular request been admitted to their acquaintance through mr elliot had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage which made a material difference in the discredit of it . colonel wallis had known mr elliot long had been well acquainted also with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story . she was certainly not a woman of family but well educated accomplished rich and excessively in love with his friend . there had been the charm . she had sought him . without that attraction not all her money would have tempted elliot and sir walter was moreover assured of her having been a very fine woman . here was a great deal to soften the business . a very fine woman with a large fortune in love with him sir walter seemed to admit it as complete apology and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light she allowed it be a great extenuation . mr elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they gave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proof of cousinly notice and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in camden place . anne listened but without quite understanding it . allowances large allowances she knew must be made for the ideas of those who spoke . she heard it all under embellishment . all that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators . still however she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared in mr elliots wishing after an interval of so many years to be well received by them . in a worldly view he had nothing to gain by being on terms with sir walter nothing to risk by a state of variance . in all probability he was already the richer of the two and the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title . a sensible man and he had looked like a very sensible man why should it be an object to him she could only offer one solution it was perhaps for elizabeths sake . there might really have been a liking formerly though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way and now that he could afford to please himself he might mean to pay his addresses to her . elizabeth was certainly very handsome with wellbred elegant manners and her character might never have been penetrated by mr elliot knowing her but in public and when very young himself . how her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one . most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice or too observant if elizabeth were his object and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so and that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea seemed apparent by a glance or two between them while mr elliots frequent visits were talked of . anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme but without being much attended to . oh yes perhaps it had been mr elliot . they did not know . it might be him perhaps . they could not listen to her description of him . they were describing him themselves sir walter especially . he did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance his air of elegance and fashion his good shaped face his sensible eye but at the same time must lament his being very much underhung a defect which time seemed to have increased nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse . mr elliot appeared to think that he sir walter was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted but sir walter had not been able to return the compliment entirely which had embarrassed him . he did not mean to complain however . mr elliot was better to look at than most men and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere . mr elliot and his friends in marlborough buildings were talked of the whole evening . colonel wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them and mr elliot so anxious that he should and there was a mrs wallis at present known only to them by description as she was in daily expectation of her confinement but mr elliot spoke of her as a most charming woman quite worthy of being known in camden place and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted . sir walter thought much of mrs wallis she was said to be an excessively pretty woman beautiful . he longed to see her . he hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets . the worst of bath was the number of its plain women . he did not mean to say that there were no pretty women but the number of the plain was out of all proportion . he had frequently observed as he walked that one handsome face would be followed by thirty or fiveandthirty frights and once as he had stood in a shop on bond street he had counted eightyseven women go by one after another without there being a tolerable face among them . it had been a frosty morning to be sure a sharp frost which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of . but still there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath and as for the men they were infinitely worse . such scarecrows as the streets were full of it was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced . he had never walked anywhere arminarm with colonel wallis who was a fine military figure though sandyhaired without observing that every womans eye was upon him every womans eye was sure to be upon colonel wallis . modest sir walter he was not allowed to escape however . his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting that colonel walliss companion might have as good a figure as colonel wallis and certainly was not sandyhaired . how is mary looking said sir walter in the height of his good humour . the last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that may not happen every day . oh no that must have been quite accidental . in general she has been in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas . if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds and grow coarse i would send her a new hat and pelisse . anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown or a cap would not be liable to any such misuse when a knock at the door suspended everything . a knock at the door and so late it was ten oclock . could it be mr elliot they knew he was to dine in lansdown crescent . it was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did . they could think of no one else . mrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliots knock . mrs clay was right . with all the state which a butler and footboy could give mr elliot was ushered into the room . it was the same the very same man with no difference but of dress . anne drew a little back while the others received his compliments and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour but he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before c .  c which was all as politely done and as politely taken as possible but her part must follow then . sir walter talked of his youngest daughter mr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter there was no occasion for remembering mary and anne smiling and blushing very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten and instantly saw with amusement at his little start of surprise that he had not been at all aware of who she was . he looked completely astonished but not more astonished than pleased his eyes brightened and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship alluded to the past and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already . he was quite as goodlooking as he had appeared at lyme his countenance improved by speaking and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be so polished so easy so particularly agreeable that she could compare them in excellence to only one persons manners . they were not the same but they were perhaps equally good . he sat down with them and improved their conversation very much . there could be no doubt of his being a sensible man . ten minutes were enough to certify that . his tone his expressions his choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all the operation of a sensible discerning mind . as soon as he could he began to talk to her of lyme wanting to compare opinions respecting the place but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time to give his own route understand something of hers and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her . she gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme . his regret increased as he listened . he had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs had heard voices mirth continually thought they must be a most delightful set of people longed to be with them but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself . if he had but asked who the party were the name of musgrove would have told him enough . well it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn which he had adopted when quite a young man on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious . the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty said he as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing are more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beings in the world . the folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view . but he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone he knew it he was soon diffused again among the others and it was only at intervals that he could return to lyme . his enquiries however produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there soon after his leaving the place . having alluded to an accident he must hear the whole . when he questioned sir walter and elizabeth began to question also but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt . she could only compare mr elliot to lady russell in the wish of really comprehending what had passed and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it . he staid an hour with them . the elegant little clock on the mantel piece had struck eleven with its silver sounds and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale before mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long . anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in camden place could have passed so well chapter 16 there was one point which anne on returning to her family would have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliots being in love with elizabeth which was her fathers not being in love with mrs clay and she was very far from easy about it when she had been at home a few hours . on going down to breakfast the next morning she found there had just been a decent pretence on the ladys side of meaning to leave them . she could imagine mrs clay to have said that now miss anne was come she could not suppose herself at all wanted for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper that must not be any reason indeed . i assure you i feel it none . she is nothing to me compared with you and she was in full time to hear her father say my dear madam this must not be . as yet you have seen nothing of bath . you have been here only to be useful . you must not run away from us now . you must stay to be acquainted with mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis . to your fine mind i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification . he spoke and looked so much in earnest that anne was not surprised to see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself . her countenance perhaps might express some watchfulness but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister . the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties and promise to stay . in the course of the same morning anne and her father chancing to be alone together he began to compliment her on her improved looks he thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks her skin her complexion greatly improved clearer fresher . had she been using any thing in particular no nothing . merely gowland he supposed . no nothing at all . ha he was surprised at that and added certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are you cannot be better than well or i should recommend gowland the constant use of gowland during the spring months . mrs clay has been using it at my recommendation and you see what it has done for her . you see how it has carried away her freckles . if elizabeth could but have heard this such personal praise might have struck her especially as it did not appear to anne that the freckles were at all lessened . but everything must take its chance . the evil of a marriage would be much diminished if elizabeth were also to marry . as for herself she might always command a home with lady russell . lady russells composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point in her intercourse in camden place . the sight of mrs clay in such favour and of anne so overlooked was a perpetual provocation to her there and vexed her as much when she was away as a person in bath who drinks the water gets all the new publications and has a very large acquaintance has time to be vexed . as mr elliot became known to her she grew more charitable or more indifferent towards the others . his manners were an immediate recommendation and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial that she was at first as she told anne almost ready to exclaim can this be mr elliot and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man . everything united in him good understanding correct opinions knowledge of the world and a warm heart . he had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour without pride or weakness he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune without display he judged for himself in everything essential without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum . he was steady observant moderate candid never run away with by spirits or by selfishness which fancied itself strong feeling and yet with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely and a value for all the felicities of domestic life which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess . she was sure that he had not been happy in marriage . colonel wallis said it and lady russell saw it but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind nor she began pretty soon to suspect to prevent his thinking of a second choice . her satisfaction in mr elliot outweighed all the plague of mrs clay . it was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently and it did not surprise her therefore that lady russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent nothing to require more motives than appeared in mr elliots great desire of a reconciliation . in lady russells view it was perfectly natural that mr elliot at a mature time of life should feel it a most desirable object and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people to be on good terms with the head of his family the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear and only erring in the heyday of youth . anne presumed however still to smile about it and at last to mention elizabeth . lady russell listened and looked and made only this cautious replyelizabeth very well time will explain . it was a reference to the future which anne after a little observation felt she must submit to . she could determine nothing at present . in that house elizabeth must be first and she was in the habit of such general observance as miss elliot that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible . mr elliot too it must be remembered had not been a widower seven months . a little delay on his side might be very excusable . in fact anne could never see the crape round his hat without fearing that she was the inexcusable one in attributing to him such imaginations for though his marriage had not been very happy still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved . however it might end he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in bath she saw nobody equal to him and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again and to see more of as herself . they went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times . he gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness . she knew it well and she remembered another persons look also . they did not always think alike . his value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers . it was not merely complaisance it must be a liking to the cause which made him enter warmly into her father and sisters solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them . the bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the dowager viscountess dalrymple and her daughter the honourable miss carteret and all the comfort of no . camden place was swept away for many days for the dalrymples in annes opinion most unfortunately were cousins of the elliots and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly . anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility and she must acknowledge herself disappointed . she had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen a wish that they had more pride for our cousins lady dalrymple and miss carteret our cousins the dalrymples sounded in her ears all day long . sir walter had once been in company with the late viscount but had never seen any of the rest of the family and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount when in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walters at the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch . no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland . the neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner for when poor lady elliot died herself no letter of condolence was received at kellynch and consequently there was but too much reason to apprehend that the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed . how to have this anxious business set to rights and be admitted as cousins again was the question and it was a question which in a more rational manner neither lady russell nor mr elliot thought unimportant . family connexions were always worth preserving good company always worth seeking lady dalrymple had taken a house for three months in laura place and would be living in style . she had been at bath the year before and lady russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman . it was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any compromise of propriety on the side of the elliots . sir walter however would choose his own means and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation regret and entreaty to his right honourable cousin . neither lady russell nor mr elliot could admire the letter but it did all that was wanted in bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess . she was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance . the toils of the business were over the sweets began . they visited in laura place they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple and the honourable miss carteret to be arranged wherever they might be most visible and our cousins in laura placeour cousin lady dalrymple and miss carteret were talked of to everybody . anne was ashamed . had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been very agreeable she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created but they were nothing . there was no superiority of manner accomplishment or understanding . lady dalrymple had acquired the name of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody . miss carteret with still less to say was so plain and so awkward that she would never have been tolerated in camden place but for her birth . lady russell confessed she had expected something better but yet it was an acquaintance worth having and when anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to mr elliot he agreed to their being nothing in themselves but still maintained that as a family connexion as good company as those who would collect good company around them they had their value . anne smiled and said my idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever wellinformed people who have a great deal of conversation that is what i call good company . you are mistaken said he gently that is not good company that is the best . good company requires only birth education and manners and with regard to education is not very nice . birth and good manners are essential but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary it will do very well . my cousin anne shakes her head . she is not satisfied . she is fastidious . my dear cousin sitting down by her you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know but will it answer will it make you happy will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible you may depend upon it that they will move in the first set in bath this winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for . yes sighed anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them then recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance . i suppose smiling i have more pride than any of you but i confess it does vex me that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them . pardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims . in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living it might be as you say but in bath sir walter elliot and his family will always be worth knowing always acceptable as acquaintance . well said anne i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place . i love your indignation said he it is very natural . but here you are in bath and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot . you talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem a little different . in one point i am sure my dear cousin he continued speaking lower though there was no one else in the room in one point i am sure we must feel alike . we must feel that every addition to your fathers society among his equals or superiors may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him . he looked as he spoke to the seat which mrs clay had been lately occupying a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant and though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride she was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her fathers getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her . chapter 17 while sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune in laura place anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very different description . she had called on her former governess and had heard from her of there being an old schoolfellow in bath who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering . miss hamilton now mrs smith had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable . anne had gone unhappy to school grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved feeling her separation from home and suffering as a girl of fourteen of strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a time and miss hamilton three years older than herself but still from the want of near relations and a settled home remaining another year at school had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery and could never be remembered with indifference . miss hamilton had left school had married not long afterwards was said to have married a man of fortune and this was all that anne had known of her till now that their governesss account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form . she was a widow and poor . her husband had been extravagant and at his death about two years before had left his affairs dreadfully involved . she had had difficulties of every sort to contend with and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs had made her for the present a cripple . she had come to bath on that account and was now in lodgings near the hot baths living in a very humble way unable even to afford herself the comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from society . their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from miss elliot would give mrs smith and anne therefore lost no time in going . she mentioned nothing of what she had heard or what she intended at home . it would excite no proper interest there . she only consulted lady russell who entered thoroughly into her sentiments and was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smiths lodgings in westgate buildings as anne chose to be taken . the visit was paid their acquaintance reestablished their interest in each other more than rekindled . the first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion . twelve years were gone since they had parted and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined . twelve years had changed anne from the blooming silent unformed girl of fifteen to the elegant little woman of sevenandtwenty with every beauty except bloom and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle and twelve years had transformed the finelooking wellgrown miss hamilton in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority into a poor infirm helpless widow receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times . anne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation . neither the dissipations of the pastand she had lived very much in the worldnor the restrictions of the present neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits . in the course of a second visit she talked with great openness and annes astonishment increased . she could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smiths . she had been very fond of her husband she had buried him . she had been used to affluence it was gone . she had no child to connect her with life and happiness again no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs no health to make all the rest supportable . her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour and a dark bedroom behind with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance which there was only one servant in the house to afford and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath . yet in spite of all this anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression to hours of occupation and enjoyment . how could it be she watched observed reflected and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only . a submissive spirit might be patient a strong understanding would supply resolution but here was something more here was that elasticity of mind that disposition to be comforted that power of turning readily from evil to good and of finding employment which carried her out of herself which was from nature alone . it was the choicest gift of heaven and anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which by a merciful appointment it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want . there had been a time mrs smith told her when her spirits had nearly failed . she could not call herself an invalid now compared with her state on first reaching bath . then she had indeed been a pitiable object for she had caught cold on the journey and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain and all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense . she had weathered it however and could truly say that it had done her good . it had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands . she had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve and would not use her ill and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse as a sister of her landlady a nurse by profession and who had always a home in that house when unemployed chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her . and she said mrs smith besides nursing me most admirably has really proved an invaluable acquaintance . as soon as i could use my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great amusement and she put me in the way of making these little threadcases pincushions and cardracks which you always find me so busy about and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood . she had a large acquaintance of course professionally among those who can afford to buy and she disposes of my merchandise . she always takes the right time for applying . everybodys heart is open you know when they have recently escaped from severe pain or are recovering the blessing of health and nurse rooke thoroughly understands when to speak . she is a shrewd intelligent sensible woman . hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has a fund of good sense and observation which as a companion make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received the best education in the world know nothing worth attending to . call it gossip if you will but when nurse rooke has half an hours leisure to bestow on me she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable something that makes one know ones species better . one likes to hear what is going on to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly . to me who live so much alone her conversation i assure you is a treat . anne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied i can easily believe it . women of that class have great opportunities and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to . such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting . what instances must pass before them of ardent disinterested selfdenying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most . a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes . yes said mrs smith more doubtingly sometimes it may though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe . here and there human nature may be great in times of trial but generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of . there is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately speaking low and tremulously there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late . anne saw the misery of such feelings . the husband had not been what he ought and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved . it was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith she shook it off and soon added in a different tone i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present will furnish much either to interest or edify me . she is only nursing mrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery . i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however . she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all the highpriced things i have in hand now . anne had called several times on her friend before the existence of such a person was known in camden place . at last it became necessary to speak of her . sir walter elizabeth and mrs clay returned one morning from laura place with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple for the same evening and anne was already engaged to spend that evening in westgate buildings . she was not sorry for the excuse . they were only asked she was sure because lady dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her and she declined on her own account with great alacrityshe was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow . they were not much interested in anything relative to anne but still there were questions enough asked to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was and elizabeth was disdainful and sir walter severe . westgate buildings said he and who is miss anne elliot to be visiting in westgate buildings a mrs smith . a widow mrs smith and who was her husband one of five thousand mr smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere . and what is her attraction that she is old and sickly . upon my word miss anne elliot you have the most extraordinary taste everything that revolts other people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations are inviting to you . but surely you may put off this old lady till tomorrow she is not so near her end i presume but that she may hope to see another day . what is her age forty no sir she is not oneandthirty but i do not think i can put off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself . she goes into the warm bath tomorrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged . but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance asked elizabeth . she sees nothing to blame in it replied anne on the contrary she approves it and has generally taken me when i have called on mrs smith . westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement observed sir walter . sir henry russells widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms but still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot . a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings a poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty a mere mrs smith an everyday mrs smith of all people and all names in the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of england and ireland mrs smith such a name mrs clay who had been present while all this passed now thought it advisable to leave the room and anne could have said much and did long to say a little in defence of her friends not very dissimilar claims to theirs but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her . she made no reply . she left it to himself to recollect that mrs smith was not the only widow in bath between thirty and forty with little to live on and no surname of dignity . anne kept her appointment the others kept theirs and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening . she had been the only one of the set absent for sir walter and elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyships service themselves but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others and had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot and mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early and lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her . anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from lady russell . to her its greatest interest must be in having been very much talked of between her friend and mr elliot in having been wished for regretted and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause . her kind compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow sick and reduced seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot . he thought her a most extraordinary young woman in her temper manners mind a model of female excellence . he could meet even lady russell in a discussion of her merits and anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create . lady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot . she was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of his deserving her and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing . she would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter of a possible attachment on his side of the desirableness of the alliance supposing such attachment to be real and returned . anne heard her and made no violent exclamations she only smiled blushed and gently shook her head . i am no matchmaker as you well know said lady russell being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations . i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together . a most suitable connection everybody must consider it but i think it might be a very happy one . mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects i think highly of him said anne but we should not suit . lady russell let this pass and only said in rejoinder i own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch the future lady elliot to look forward and see you occupying your dear mothers place succeeding to all her rights and all her popularity as well as to all her virtues would be the highest possible gratification to me . you are your mothers self in countenance and disposition and if i might be allowed to fancy you such as she was in situation and name and home presiding and blessing in the same spot and only superior to her in being more highly valued my dearest anne it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life anne was obliged to turn away to rise to walk to a distant table and leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings this picture excited . for a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched . the idea of becoming what her mother had been of having the precious name of lady elliot first revived in herself of being restored to kellynch calling it her home again her home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist . lady russell said not another word willing to leave the matter to its own operation and believing that could mr elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himselfshe believed in short what anne did not believe . the same image of mr elliot speaking for himself brought anne to composure again . the charm of kellynch and of lady elliot all faded away . she never could accept him . and it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one her judgement on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against mr elliot . though they had now been acquainted a month she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character . that he was a sensible man an agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all clear enough . he certainly knew what was right nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct . she distrusted the past if not the present . the names which occasionally dropt of former associates the allusions to former practices and pursuits suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been . she saw that there had been bad habits that sunday travelling had been a common thing that there had been a period of his life and probably not a short one when he had been at least careless in all serious matters and though he might now think very differently who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever cautious man grown old enough to appreciate a fair character how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed mr elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not open . there was never any burst of feeling any warmth of indignation or delight at the evil or good of others . this to anne was a decided imperfection . her early impressions were incurable . she prized the frank the openhearted the eager character beyond all others . warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still . she felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing than of those whose presence of mind never varied whose tongue never slipped . mr elliot was too generally agreeable . various as were the tempers in her fathers house he pleased them all . he endured too well stood too well with every body . he had spoken to her with some degree of openness of mrs clay had appeared completely to see what mrs clay was about and to hold her in contempt and yet mrs clay found him as agreeable as any body . lady russell saw either less or more than her young friend for she saw nothing to excite distrust . she could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church in the course of the following autumn . chapter 18 it was the beginning of february and anne having been a month in bath was growing very eager for news from uppercross and lyme . she wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated . it was three weeks since she had heard at all . she only knew that henrietta was at home again and that louisa though considered to be recovering fast was still in lyme and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening when a thicker letter than usual from mary was delivered to her and to quicken the pleasure and surprise with admiral and mrs crofts compliments . the crofts must be in bath a circumstance to interest her . they were people whom her heart turned to very naturally . what is this cried sir walter . the crofts have arrived in bath the crofts who rent kellynch what have they brought you a letter from uppercross cottage sir . oh those letters are convenient passports . they secure an introduction . i should have visited admiral croft however at any rate . i know what is due to my tenant . anne could listen no longer she could not even have told how the poor admirals complexion escaped her letter engrossed her . it had been begun several days back . february 1st . my dear annei make no apology for my silence because i know how little people think of letters in such a place as bath . you must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross which as you well know affords little to write about . we have had a very dull christmas mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays . i do not reckon the hayters as anybody . the holidays however are over at last i believe no children ever had such long ones . i am sure i had not . the house was cleared yesterday except of the little harvilles but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home . mrs harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long . i do not understand it . they are not at all nice children in my opinion but mrs musgrove seems to like them quite as well if not better than her grandchildren . what dreadful weather we have had it may not be felt in bath with your nice pavements but in the country it is of some consequence . i have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january except charles hayter who had been calling much oftener than was welcome . between ourselves i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme as long as louisa it would have kept her a little out of his way . the carriage is gone today to bring louisa and the harvilles tomorrow . we are not asked to dine with them however till the day after mrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey which is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there tomorrow . i am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable and wish i could be acquainted with him too but i have my usual luck i am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on always the last of my family to be noticed . what an immense time mrs clay has been staying with elizabeth does she never mean to go away but perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant we might not be invited . let me know what you think of this . i do not expect my children to be asked you know . i can leave them at the great house very well for a month or six weeks . i have this moment heard that the crofts are going to bath almost immediately they think the admiral gouty . charles heard it quite by chance they have not had the civility to give me any notice or of offering to take anything . i do not think they improve at all as neighbours . we see nothing of them and this is really an instance of gross inattention . charles joins me in love and everything proper . yours affectionately mary m .  i am sorry to say that i am very far from well and jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sorethroat very much about . i dare say i shall catch it and my sorethroats you know are always worse than anybodys . so ended the first part which had been afterwards put into an envelope containing nearly as much more . i kept my letter open that i might send you word how louisa bore her journey and now i am extremely glad i did having a great deal to add . in the first place i had a note from mrs croft yesterday offering to convey anything to you a very kind friendly note indeed addressed to me just as it ought i shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as i like . the admiral does not seem very ill and i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wants . i shall be truly glad to have them back again . our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant family . but now for louisa . i have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little . she and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely and in the evening we went to ask her how she did when we were rather surprised not to find captain benwick of the party for he had been invited as well as the harvilles and what do you think was the reason neither more nor less than his being in love with louisa and not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer from mr musgrove for it was all settled between him and her before she came away and he had written to her father by captain harville . true upon my honour are not you astonished i shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it for i never did . mrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter . we are all very well pleased however for though it is not equal to her marrying captain wentworth it is infinitely better than charles hayter and mr musgrove has written his consent and captain benwick is expected today . mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sisters account but however louisa is a great favourite with both . indeed mrs harville and i quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her . charles wonders what captain wentworth will say but if you remember i never thought him attached to louisa i never could see anything of it . and this is the end you see of captain benwicks being supposed to be an admirer of yours . how charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me . i hope he will be more agreeable now . certainly not a great match for louisa musgrove but a million times better than marrying among the hayters . mary need not have feared her sisters being in any degree prepared for the news . she had never in her life been more astonished . captain benwick and louisa musgrove it was almost too wonderful for belief and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room preserve an air of calmness and answer the common questions of the moment . happily for her they were not many . sir walter wanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath as it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in but had little curiosity beyond . how is mary said elizabeth and without waiting for an answer and pray what brings the crofts to bath they come on the admirals account . he is thought to be gouty . gout and decrepitude said sir walter . poor old gentleman . have they any acquaintance here asked elizabeth . i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral crofts time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this . i suspect said sir walter coolly that admiral croft will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall . elizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place oh no i think not . situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve . if we were not related it would not signify but as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours . we had better leave the crofts to find their own level . there are several oddlooking men walking about here who i am told are sailors . the crofts will associate with them . this was sir walter and elizabeths share of interest in the letter when mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention in an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove and her fine little boys anne was at liberty . in her own room she tried to comprehend it . well might charles wonder how captain wentworth would feel perhaps he had quitted the field had given louisa up had ceased to love had found he did not love her . she could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend . she could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly . captain benwick and louisa musgrove the highspirited joyoustalking louisa musgrove and the dejected thinking feeling reading captain benwick seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other . their minds most dissimilar where could have been the attraction the answer soon presented itself . it had been in situation . they had been thrown together several weeks they had been living in the same small family party since henriettas coming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other and louisa just recovering from illness had been in an interesting state and captain benwick was not inconsolable . that was a point which anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawing the same conclusion as mary from the present course of events they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself . she did not mean however to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than mary might have allowed . she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment . he had an affectionate heart . he must love somebody . she saw no reason against their being happy . louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with and they would soon grow more alike . he would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast for scott and lord byron nay that was probably learnt already of course they had fallen in love over poetry . the idea of louisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste and sentimental reflection was amusing but she had no doubt of its being so . the day at lyme the fall from the cobb might influence her health her nerves her courage her character to the end of her life as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate . the conclusion of the whole was that if the woman who had been sensible of captain wentworths merits could be allowed to prefer another man there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder and if captain wentworth lost no friend by it certainly nothing to be regretted . no it was not regret which made annes heart beat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free . she had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate . they were too much like joy senseless joy she longed to see the crofts but when the meeting took place it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them . the visit of ceremony was paid and returned and louisa musgrove was mentioned and captain benwick too without even half a smile . the crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street perfectly to sir walters satisfaction . he was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more about the admiral than the admiral ever thought or talked about him . the crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for and considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure . they brought with them their country habit of being almost always together . he was ordered to walk to keep off the gout and mrs croft seemed to go shares with him in everything and to walk for her life to do him good . anne saw them wherever she went . lady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning and she never failed to think of them and never failed to see them . knowing their feelings as she did it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . she always watched them as long as she could delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of as they walked along in happy independence or equally delighted to see the admirals hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy mrs croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her . anne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herself but it so happened that one morning about a week or ten days after the crofts arrival it suited her best to leave her friend or her friends carriage in the lower part of the town and return alone to camden place and in walking up milsom street she had the good fortune to meet with the admiral . he was standing by himself at a printshop window with his hands behind him in earnest contemplation of some print and she not only might have passed him unseen but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice . when he did perceive and acknowledge her however it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour . ha is it you thank you thank you . this is treating me like a friend . here i am you see staring at a picture . i can never get by this shop without stopping . but what a thing here is by way of a boat do look at it . did you ever see the like what queer fellows your fine painters must be to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that and yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease and looking about them at the rocks and mountains as if they were not to be upset the next moment which they certainly must be . i wonder where that boat was built laughing heartily i would not venture over a horsepond in it . well turning away now where are you bound can i go anywhere for you or with you can i be of any use none i thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together . i am going home . that i will with all my heart and farther too . yes yes we will have a snug walk together and i have something to tell you as we go along . there take my arm thats right i do not feel comfortable if i have not a woman there . lord what a boat it is taking a last look at the picture as they began to be in motion . did you say that you had something to tell me sir yes i have presently . but here comes a friend captain brigden i shall only say how dye do as we pass however . i shall not stop . how dye do brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife . she poor soul is tied by the leg . she has a blister on one of her heels as large as a threeshilling piece . if you look across the street you will see admiral brand coming down and his brother . shabby fellows both of them i am glad they are not on this side of the way . sophy cannot bear them . they played me a pitiful trick once got away with some of my best men . i will tell you the whole story another time . there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson . look he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wife . ah the peace has come too soon for that younker . poor old sir archibald how do you like bath miss elliot it suits us very well . we are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets full of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat and then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings and draw in our chairs and are snug as if we were at kellynch ay or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal . we do not like our lodgings here the worse i can tell you for putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth . the wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way . when they were got a little farther anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate . she hoped when clear of milsom street to have her curiosity gratified but she was still obliged to wait for the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of belmont and as she was not really mrs croft she must let him have his own way . as soon as they were fairly ascending belmont he began well now you shall hear something that will surprise you . but first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady i am going to talk about . that young lady you know that we have all been so concerned for . the miss musgrove that all this has been happening to . her christian name i always forget her christian name . anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did but now she could safely suggest the name of louisa . ay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name . i wish young ladies had not such a number of fine christian names . i should never be out if they were all sophys or something of that sort . well this miss louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick . he was courting her week after week . the only wonder was what they could be waiting for till the business at lyme came then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right . but even then there was something odd in their way of going on . instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymouth and then he went off to see edward . when we came back from minehead he was gone down to edwards and there he has been ever since . we have seen nothing of him since november . even sophy could not understand it . but now the matter has take the strangest turn of all for this young lady the same miss musgrove instead of being to marry frederick is to marry james benwick . you know james benwick . a little . i am a little acquainted with captain benwick . well she is to marry him . nay most likely they are married already for i do not know what they should wait for . i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man said anne and i understand that he bears an excellent character . oh yes yes there is not a word to be said against james benwick . he is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are bad times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know of . an excellent goodhearted fellow i assure you a very active zealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice . indeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want of spirit from captain benwicks manners . i thought them particularly pleasing and i will answer for it they would generally please . well well ladies are the best judges but james benwick is rather too piano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality sophy and i cannot help thinking fredericks manners better than his . there is something about frederick more to our taste . anne was caught . she had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other not at all to represent captain benwicks manners as the very best that could possibly be and after a little hesitation she was beginning to say i was not entering into any comparison of the two friends but the admiral interrupted her with and the thing is certainly true . it is not a mere bit of gossip . we have it from frederick himself . his sister had a letter from him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it in a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercross . i fancy they are all at uppercross . this was an opportunity which anne could not resist she said therefore i hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of captain wentworths letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy . it did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him and louisa musgrove but i hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally and without violence . i hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an illused man . not at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end . anne looked down to hide her smile . no no frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has too much spirit for that . if the girl likes another man better it is very fit she should have him . certainly . but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing in captain wentworths manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself illused by his friend which might appear you know without its being absolutely said . i should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick should be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort . yes yes i understand you . but there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter . he does not give the least fling at benwick does not so much as say i wonder at it i have a reason of my own for wondering at it . no you would not guess from his way of writing that he had ever thought of this miss whats her name for himself . he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is nothing very unforgiving in that i think . anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant to convey but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther . she therefore satisfied herself with commonplace remarks or quiet attention and the admiral had it all his own way . poor frederick said he at last . now he must begin all over again with somebody else . i think we must get him to bath . sophy must write and beg him to come to bath . here are pretty girls enough i am sure . it would be of no use to go to uppercross again for that other miss musgrove i find is bespoke by her cousin the young parson . do not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bath chapter 19 while admiral croft was taking this walk with anne and expressing his wish of getting captain wentworth to bath captain wentworth was already on his way thither . before mrs croft had written he was arrived and the very next time anne walked out she saw him . mr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay . they were in milsom street . it began to rain not much but enough to make shelter desirable for women and quite enough to make it very desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in lady dalrymples carriage which was seen waiting at a little distance she anne and mrs clay therefore turned into mollands while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple to request her assistance . he soon joined them again successful of course lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them home and would call for them in a few minutes . her ladyships carriage was a barouche and did not hold more than four with any comfort . miss carteret was with her mother consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three camden place ladies . there could be no doubt as to miss elliot . whoever suffered inconvenience she must suffer none but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two . the rain was a mere trifle and anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot . but the rain was also a mere trifle to mrs clay she would hardly allow it even to drop at all and her boots were so thick much thicker than miss annes and in short her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with mr elliot as anne could be and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were obliged to settle it for them miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay had a little cold already and mr elliot deciding on appeal that his cousin annes boots were rather the thickest . it was fixed accordingly that mrs clay should be of the party in the carriage and they had just reached this point when anne as she sat near the window descried most decidedly and distinctly captain wentworth walking down the street . her start was perceptible only to herself but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable and absurd for a few minutes she saw nothing before her it was all confusion . she was lost and when she had scolded back her senses she found the others still waiting for the carriage and mr elliot always obliging just setting off for union street on a commission of mrs clays . she now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door she wanted to see if it rained . why was she to suspect herself of another motive captain wentworth must be out of sight . she left her seat she would go one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was . she would see if it rained . she was sent back however in a moment by the entrance of captain wentworth himself among a party of gentlemen and ladies evidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined a little below milsom street . he was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before he looked quite red . for the first time since their renewed acquaintance she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two . she had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments . all the overpowering blinding bewildering first effects of strong surprise were over with her . still however she had enough to feel it was agitation pain pleasure a something between delight and misery . he spoke to her and then turned away . the character of his manner was embarrassment . she could not have called it either cold or friendly or anything so certainly as embarrassed . after a short interval however he came towards her and spoke again . mutual enquiries on common subjects passed neither of them probably much the wiser for what they heard and anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly . they had by dint of being so very much together got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness but he could not do it now . time had changed him or louisa had changed him . there was consciousness of some sort or other . he looked very well not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits and he talked of uppercross of the musgroves nay even of louisa and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her but yet it was captain wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that he was . it did not surprise but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth would not know him . she saw that he saw elizabeth that elizabeth saw him that there was complete internal recognition on each side she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance expecting it and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness . lady dalrymples carriage for which miss elliot was growing very impatient now drew up the servant came in to announce it . it was beginning to rain again and altogether there was a delay and a bustle and a talking which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey miss elliot . at last miss elliot and her friend unattended but by the servant for there was no cousin returned were walking off and captain wentworth watching them turned again to anne and by manner rather than words was offering his services to her . i am much obliged to you was her answer but i am not going with them . the carriage would not accommodate so many . i walk i prefer walking . but it rains . oh very little nothing that i regard . after a moments pause he said though i came only yesterday i have equipped myself properly for bath already you see pointing to a new umbrella i wish you would make use of it if you are determined to walk though i think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair . she was very much obliged to him but declined it all repeating her conviction that the rain would come to nothing at present and adding i am only waiting for mr elliot . he will be here in a moment i am sure . she had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in . captain wentworth recollected him perfectly . there was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme admiring anne as she passed except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend . he came in with eagerness appeared to see and think only of her apologised for his stay was grieved to have kept her waiting and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased and in another moment they walked off together her arm under his a gentle and embarrassed glance and a good morning to you being all that she had time for as she passed away . as soon as they were out of sight the ladies of captain wentworths party began talking of them . mr elliot does not dislike his cousin i fancy oh no that is clear enough . one can guess what will happen there . he is always with them half lives in the family i believe . what a very goodlooking man yes and miss atkinson who dined with him once at the wallises says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with . she is pretty i think anne elliot very pretty when one comes to look at her . it is not the fashion to say so but i confess i admire her more than her sister . oh so do i .  and so do i .  no comparison . but the men are all wild after miss elliot . anne is too delicate for them . anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin if he would have walked by her side all the way to camden place without saying a word . she had never found it so difficult to listen to him though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care and though his subjects were principally such as were wont to be always interesting praise warm just and discriminating of lady russell and insinuations highly rational against mrs clay . but just now she could think only of captain wentworth . she could not understand his present feelings whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not and till that point were settled she could not be quite herself . she hoped to be wise and reasonable in time but alas alas she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet . another circumstance very essential for her to know was how long he meant to be in bath he had not mentioned it or she could not recollect it . he might be only passing through . but it was more probable that he should be come to stay . in that case so liable as every body was to meet every body in bath lady russell would in all likelihood see him somewhere . would she recollect him how would it all be she had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove was to marry captain benwick . it had cost her something to encounter lady russells surprise and now if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with captain wentworth her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him . the following morning anne was out with her friend and for the first hour in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain but at last in returning down pulteney street she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street . there were many other men about him many groups walking the same way but there was no mistaking him . she looked instinctively at lady russell but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself . no it was not to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite . she looked at her however from time to time anxiously and when the moment approached which must point him out though not daring to look again for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen she was yet perfectly conscious of lady russells eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him of her being in short intently observing him . she could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russells mind the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him and in foreign climes and in active service too without robbing him of one personal grace at last lady russell drew back her head . now how would she speak of him you will wonder said she what has been fixing my eye so long but i was looking after some windowcurtains which lady alicia and mrs frankland were telling me of last night . they described the drawingroom windowcurtains of one of the houses on this side of the way and this part of the street as being the handsomest and best hung of any in bath but could not recollect the exact number and i have been trying to find out which it could be but i confess i can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description . anne sighed and blushed and smiled in pity and disdain either at her friend or herself . the part which provoked her most was that in all this waste of foresight and caution she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them . a day or two passed without producing anything . the theatre or the rooms where he was most likely to be were not fashionable enough for the elliots whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties in which they were getting more and more engaged and anne wearied of such a state of stagnation sick of knowing nothing and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried was quite impatient for the concert evening . it was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple . of course they must attend . it was really expected to be a good one and captain wentworth was very fond of music . if she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again she fancied she should be satisfied and as to the power of addressing him she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred . elizabeth had turned from him lady russell overlooked him her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances she felt that she owed him attention . she had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow . mrs smith gave a most goodhumoured acquiescence . by all means said she only tell me all about it when you do come . who is your party anne named them all . mrs smith made no reply but when she was leaving her said and with an expression half serious half arch well i heartily wish your concert may answer and do not fail me tomorrow if you can come for i begin to have a foreboding that i may not have many more visits from you . anne was startled and confused but after standing in a moments suspense was obliged and not sorry to be obliged to hurry away . chapter 20 sir walter his two daughters and mrs clay were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening and as lady dalrymple must be waited for they took their station by one of the fires in the octagon room . but hardly were they so settled when the door opened again and captain wentworth walked in alone . anne was the nearest to him and making yet a little advance she instantly spoke . he was preparing only to bow and pass on but her gentle how do you do brought him out of the straight line to stand near her and make enquiries in return in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground . their being in the back ground was a support to anne she knew nothing of their looks and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done . while they were speaking a whispering between her father and elizabeth caught her ear . she could not distinguish but she must guess the subject and on captain wentworths making a distant bow she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself . this though late and reluctant and ungracious was yet better than nothing and her spirits improved . after talking however of the weather and bath and the concert their conversation began to flag and so little was said at last that she was expecting him to go every moment but he did not he seemed in no hurry to leave her and presently with renewed spirit with a little smile a little glow he said i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme . i am afraid you must have suffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you at the time . she assured him that she had not . it was a frightful hour said he a frightful day and he passed his hand across his eyes as if the remembrance were still too painful but in a moment half smiling again added the day has produced some effects however has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful . when you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery . certainly i could have none . but it appearsi should hope it would be a very happy match . there are on both sides good principles and good temper . yes said he looking not exactly forward but there i think ends the resemblance . with all my soul i wish them happy and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it . they have no difficulties to contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays . the musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughters comfort . all this is much very much in favour of their happiness more than perhaps he stopped . a sudden recollection seemed to occur and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening annes cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground . after clearing his throat however he proceeded thus i confess that i do think there is a disparity too great a disparity and in a point no less essential than mind . i regard louisa musgrove as a very amiable sweettempered girl and not deficient in understanding but benwick is something more . he is a clever man a reading man and i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise . had it been the effect of gratitude had he learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring him it would have been another thing . but i have no reason to suppose it so . it seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous untaught feeling on his side and this surprises me . a man like him in his situation with a heart pierced wounded almost broken fanny harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to her was indeed attachment . a man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman . he ought not he does not . either from the consciousness however that his friend had recovered or from other consciousness he went no farther and anne who in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered and in spite of all the various noises of the room the almost ceaseless slam of the door and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through had distinguished every word was struck gratified confused and beginning to breathe very quick and feel an hundred things in a moment . it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject and yet after a pause feeling the necessity of speaking and having not the smallest wish for a total change she only deviated so far as to say you were a good while at lyme i think about a fortnight . i could not leave it till louisas doing well was quite ascertained . i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace . it had been my doing solely mine . she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak . the country round lyme is very fine . i walked and rode a great deal and the more i saw the more i found to admire . i should very much like to see lyme again said anne . indeed i should not have supposed that you could have found anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling . the horror and distress you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been strong disgust . the last hours were certainly very painful replied anne but when pain is over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure . one does not love a place the less for having suffered in it unless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which was by no means the case at lyme . we were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment . so much novelty and beauty i have travelled so little that every fresh place would be interesting to me but there is real beauty at lyme and in short with a faint blush at some recollections altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable . as she ceased the entrance door opened again and the very party appeared for whom they were waiting . lady dalrymple lady dalrymple was the rejoicing sound and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her . lady dalrymple and miss carteret escorted by mr elliot and colonel wallis who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant advanced into the room . the others joined them and it was a group in which anne found herself also necessarily included . she was divided from captain wentworth . their interesting almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on she had learnt in the last ten minutes more of his feelings towards louisa more of all his feelings than she dared to think of and she gave herself up to the demands of the party to the needful civilities of the moment with exquisite though agitated sensations . she was in good humour with all . she had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all and to pity every one as being less happy than herself . the delightful emotions were a little subdued when on stepping back from the group to be joined again by captain wentworth she saw that he was gone . she was just in time to see him turn into the concert room . he was gone he had disappeared she felt a moments regret . but they should meet again . he would look for her he would find her out before the evening were over and at present perhaps it was as well to be asunder . she was in need of a little interval for recollection . upon lady russells appearance soon afterwards the whole party was collected and all that remained was to marshal themselves and proceed into the concert room and be of all the consequence in their power draw as many eyes excite as many whispers and disturb as many people as they could . very very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in . elizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret and looking on the broad back of the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach and annebut it would be an insult to the nature of annes felicity to draw any comparison between it and her sisters the origin of one all selfish vanity of the other all generous attachment . anne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room . her happiness was from within . her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed but she knew nothing about it . she was thinking only of the last half hour and as they passed to their seats her mind took a hasty range over it . his choice of subjects his expressions and still more his manner and look had been such as she could see in only one light . his opinion of louisa musgroves inferiority an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give his wonder at captain benwick his feelings as to a first strong attachment sentences begun which he could not finish his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance all all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least that anger resentment avoidance were no more and that they were succeeded not merely by friendship and regard but by the tenderness of the past . yes some share of the tenderness of the past . she could not contemplate the change as implying less . he must love her . these were thoughts with their attendant visions which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him without even trying to discern him . when their places were determined on and they were all properly arranged she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room but he was not her eye could not reach him and the concert being just opening she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way . the party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches anne was among those on the foremost and mr elliot had manoeuvred so well with the assistance of his friend colonel wallis as to have a seat by her . miss elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object of colonel walliss gallantry was quite contented . annes mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening it was just occupation enough she had feelings for the tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientific and patience for the wearisome and had never liked a concert better at least during the first act . towards the close of it in the interval succeeding an italian song she explained the words of the song to mr elliot . they had a concert bill between them . this said she is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words for certainly the sense of an italian lovesong must not be talked of but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend to understand the language . i am a very poor italian scholar . yes yes i see you are . i see you know nothing of the matter . you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear comprehensible elegant english . you need not say anything more of your ignorance . here is complete proof . i will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient . i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long replied he without knowing something of miss anne elliot and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman . for shame for shame this is too much flattery . i forget what we are to have next turning to the bill . perhaps said mr elliot speaking low i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of . indeed how so you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family . i knew you by report long before you came to bath . i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately . i have been acquainted with you by character many years . your person your disposition accomplishments manner they were all present to me . mr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise . no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery . to have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless people is irresistible and anne was all curiosity . she wondered and questioned him eagerly but in vain . he delighted in being asked but he would not tell . no no some time or other perhaps but not now . he would mention no names now but such he could assure her had been the fact . he had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited the warmest curiosity to know her . anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford captain wentworths brother . he might have been in mr elliots company but she had not courage to ask the question . the name of anne elliot said he has long had an interesting sound to me . very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if i dared i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change . such she believed were his words but scarcely had she received their sound than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her which rendered every thing else trivial . her father and lady dalrymple were speaking . a welllooking man said sir walter a very welllooking man . a very fine young man indeed said lady dalrymple . more air than one often sees in bath . irish i dare say . no i just know his name . a bowing acquaintance . wentworth captain wentworth of the navy . his sister married my tenant in somersetshire the croft who rents kellynch . before sir walter had reached this point annes eyes had caught the right direction and distinguished captain wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance . as her eyes fell on him his seemed to be withdrawn from her . it had that appearance . it seemed as if she had been one moment too late and as long as she dared observe he did not look again but the performance was recommencing and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward . when she could give another glance he had moved away . he could not have come nearer to her if he would she was so surrounded and shut in but she would rather have caught his eye . mr elliots speech too distressed her . she had no longer any inclination to talk to him . she wished him not so near her . the first act was over . now she hoped for some beneficial change and after a period of nothingsaying amongst the party some of them did decide on going in quest of tea . anne was one of the few who did not choose to move . she remained in her seat and so did lady russell but she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot and she did not mean whatever she might feel on lady russells account to shrink from conversation with captain wentworth if he gave her the opportunity . she was persuaded by lady russells countenance that she had seen him . he did not come however . anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance but he never came . the anxious interval wore away unproductively . the others returned the room filled again benches were reclaimed and repossessed and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed . to anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation . she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth once more without the interchange of one friendly look . in resettling themselves there were now many changes the result of which was favourable for her . colonel wallis declined sitting down again and mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret in a manner not to be refused to sit between them and by some other removals and a little scheming of her own anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before much more within reach of a passerby . she could not do so without comparing herself with miss larolles the inimitable miss larolles but still she did it and not with much happier effect though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed . such was her situation with a vacant space at hand when captain wentworth was again in sight . she saw him not far off . he saw her too yet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her . she felt that something must be the matter . the change was indubitable . the difference between his present air and what it had been in the octagon room was strikingly great . why was it she thought of her father of lady russell . could there have been any unpleasant glances he began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the captain wentworth of uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singing and in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over . anne replied and spoke in defence of the performance so well and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance improved and he replied again with almost a smile . they talked for a few minutes more the improvement held he even looked down towards the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round . it came from mr elliot . he begged her pardon but she must be applied to to explain italian again . miss carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung . anne could not refuse but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit . a few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumed and when her own mistress again when able to turn and look as she had done before she found herself accosted by captain wentworth in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell . he must wish her good night he was going he should get home as fast as he could . is not this song worth staying for said anne suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging . no he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying for and he was gone directly . jealousy of mr elliot it was the only intelligible motive . captain wentworth jealous of her affection could she have believed it a week ago three hours ago for a moment the gratification was exquisite . but alas there were very different thoughts to succeed . how was such jealousy to be quieted how was the truth to reach him how in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations would he ever learn of her real sentiments it was misery to think of mr elliots attentions . their evil was incalculable . chapter 21 anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to mrs smith meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call for to avoid mr elliot was almost a first object . she felt a great deal of goodwill towards him . in spite of the mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard perhaps compassion . she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance of the right which he seemed to have to interest her by everything in situation by his own sentiments by his early prepossession . it was altogether very extraordinary flattering but painful . there was much to regret . how she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case was not worth enquiry for there was a captain wentworth and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad her affection would be his for ever . their union she believed could not divide her more from other men than their final separation . prettier musings of highwrought love and eternal constancy could never have passed along the streets of bath than anne was sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings . it was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way . she was sure of a pleasant reception and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected her though it had been an appointment . an account of the concert was immediately claimed and annes recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it . all that she could tell she told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been there and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith who had already heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company . everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath was well know by name to mrs smith . the little durands were there i conclude said she with their mouths open to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed . they never miss a concert . yes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were in the room . the ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties with the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them . i do not know . i do not think they were . old lady mary maclean i need not ask after her . she never misses i know and you must have seen her . she must have been in your own circle for as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur round the orchestra of course . no that was what i dreaded . it would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect . but happily lady dalrymple always chooses to be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is for hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen very little . oh you saw enough for your own amusement . i can understand . there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd and this you had . you were a large party in yourselves and you wanted nothing beyond . but i ought to have looked about me more said anne conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about that the object only had been deficient . no no you were better employed . you need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening . i see it in your eye . i perfectly see how the hours passed that you had always something agreeable to listen to . in the intervals of the concert it was conversation . anne half smiled and said do you see that in my eye yes i do . your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together . a blush overspread annes cheeks . she could say nothing . and such being the case continued mrs smith after a short pause i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning . it is really very good of you to come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time . anne heard nothing of this . she was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friends penetration unable to imagine how any report of captain wentworth could have reached her . after another short silence pray said mrs smith is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me does he know that i am in bath mr elliot repeated anne looking up surprised . a moments reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under . she caught it instantaneously and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon added more composedly are you acquainted with mr elliot i have been a good deal acquainted with him replied mrs smith gravely but it seems worn out now . it is a great while since we met . i was not at all aware of this . you never mentioned it before . had i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you . to confess the truth said mrs smith assuming her usual air of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have . i want you to talk about me to mr elliot . i want your interest with him . he can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness my dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself of course it is done . i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you replied anne but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot a greater right to influence him than is really the case . i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion . you must consider me only as mr elliots relation . if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him i beg you would not hesitate to employ me . mrs smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said i have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon . i ought to have waited for official information but now my dear miss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak . next week to be sure by next week i may be allowed to think it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on mr elliots good fortune . no replied anne nor next week nor next nor next . i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week . i am not going to marry mr elliot . i should like to know why you imagine i am mrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled shook her head and exclaimed now how i do wish i understood you how i do wish i knew what you were at i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel when the right moment occurs . till it does come you know we women never mean to have anybody . it is a thing of course among us that every man is refused till he offers . but why should you be cruel let me plead for mypresent friend i cannot call him but for my former friend . where can you look for a more suitable match where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man let me recommend mr elliot . i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis my dear mrs smith mr elliots wife has not been dead much above half a year . he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one . oh if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archly mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him . do not forget me when you are married thats all . let him know me to be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps . ninetynine out of a hundred would do the same . of course he cannot be aware of the importance to me . well my dear miss elliot i hope and trust you will be very happy . mr elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman . your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been . you are safe in all worldly matters and safe in his character . he will not be led astray he will not be misled by others to his ruin . no said anne i can readily believe all that of my cousin . he seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions . i consider him with great respect . i have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation to do otherwise . but i have not known him long and he is not a man i think to be known intimately soon . will not this manner of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me surely this must be calm enough . and upon my word he is nothing to me . should he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing i shall not accept him . i assure you i shall not . i assure you mr elliot had not the share which you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that she stopped regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much but less would hardly have been sufficient . mrs smith would hardly have believed so soon in mr elliots failure but from the perception of there being a somebody else . as it was she instantly submitted and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond and anne eager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why mrs smith should have fancied she was to marry mr elliot where she could have received the idea or from whom she could have heard it . do tell me how it first came into your head . it first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how much you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way . but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago . and has it indeed been spoken of did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday no . was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid i observed no one in particular . it was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who bythebye had a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way to let you in . she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot . she had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority . she sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history . the whole history repeated anne laughing . she could not make a very long history i think of one such little article of unfounded news . mrs smith said nothing . but continued anne presently though there is no truth in my having this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that i could . shall i mention to him your being in bath shall i take any message no i thank you no certainly not . in the warmth of the moment and under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances but not now . no i thank you i have nothing to trouble you with . i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years i did . not before he was married i suppose yes he was not married when i knew him first . andwere you much acquainted intimately . indeed then do tell me what he was at that time of life . i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man . was he at all such as he appears now i have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smiths answer given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity . they were both silent mrs smith very thoughtful . at last i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cried in her natural tone of cordiality i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do . i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you . there were many things to be taken into the account . one hates to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief . even the smooth surface of familyunion seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath . however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliots real character . though i fully believe that at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may happen . you might some time or other be differently affected towards him . hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced . mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience a designing wary coldblooded being who thinks only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character . he has no feeling for others . those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction . he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion . oh he is black at heart hollow and black annes astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause and in a calmer manner she added my expressions startle you . you must allow for an injured angry woman . but i will try to command myself . i will not abuse him . i will only tell you what i have found him . facts shall speak . he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself . the intimacy had been formed before our marriage . i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion of him . at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost always together . we were principally in town living in very good style . he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman . he had always a home with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother . my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse was open to him i know that he often assisted him . this must have been about that very period of mr elliots life said anne which has always excited my particular curiosity . it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister . i never knew him myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times . it seemed to announce a different sort of man . i know it all i know it all cried mrs smith . he had been introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak of them for ever . i know he was invited and encouraged and i know he did not choose to go . i can satisfy you perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage i knew all about it at the time . i was privy to all the fors and againsts i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer any question you may wish to put . nay said anne i have no particular enquiry to make about her . i have always understood they were not a happy couple . but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my fathers acquaintance as he did . my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him . why did mr elliot draw back mr elliot replied mrs smith at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law . he was determined to make it by marriage . he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence . that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you . he told me the whole story . he had no concealments with me . it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister . he described one miss elliot and i thought very affectionately of the other . perhaps cried anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliot to be sure i did very often . i used to boast of my own anne elliot and vouch for your being a very different creature from she checked herself just in time . this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night cried anne . this explains it . i found he had been used to hear of me . i could not comprehend how . what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned how sure to be mistaken but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you . mr elliot married then completely for money the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes to his character . mrs smith hesitated a little here . oh those things are too common . when one lives in the world a man or womans marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought . i was very young and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless gay set without any strict rules of conduct . we lived for enjoyment . i think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot was doing . to do the best for himself passed as a duty . but was not she a very low woman yes which i objected to but he would not regard . money money was all that he wanted . her father was a grazier her grandfather had been a butcher but that was all nothing . she was a fine woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliots company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth . all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself . depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it . his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt . i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject . it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof . indeed my dear mrs smith i want none cried anne . you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago . this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe . i am more curious to know why he should be so different now . but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary stay i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet . anne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was desired . the box was brought and placed before her and mrs smith sighing over it as she unlocked it said this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him . the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine . but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed . here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy . i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it . this was the letter directed to charles smith esq . tunbridge wells and dated from london as far back as july 1803  dear smithi have received yours . your kindness almost overpowers me . i wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but i have lived threeandtwenty years in the world and have seen none like it . at present believe me i have no need of your services being in cash again . give me joy i have got rid of sir walter and miss . they are gone back to kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them this summer but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer . the baronet nevertheless is not unlikely to marry again he is quite fool enough . if he does however they will leave me in peace which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion . he is worse than last year . i wish i had any name but elliot . i am sick of it . the name of walter i can drop thank god and i desire you will never insult me with my second w .  again meaning for the rest of my life to be only yours trulywm . elliot . such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow and mrs smith observing the high colour in her face said the language i know is highly disrespectful . though i have forgot the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning . but it shows you the man . mark his professions to my poor husband . can any thing be stronger anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father . she was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over and say thank you . this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing you were saying . but why be acquainted with us now i can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling . can you really yes . i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago and i will shew him as he is now . i cannot produce written proof again but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what he is now wanting and what he is now doing . he is no hypocrite now . he truly wants to marry you . his present attentions to your family are very sincere quite from the heart . i will give you my authority his friend colonel wallis . colonel wallis you are acquainted with him no . it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that it takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence . the stream is as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away . mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom he tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her . she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all to her nurse and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you very naturally brings it all to me . on monday evening my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings . when i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was not romancing so much as you supposed . my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient . this will not do . mr elliots having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father . that was all prior to my coming to bath . i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived . i know you did i know it all perfectly but indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information in such a line . facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another can hardly have much truth left . only give me a hearing . you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm . nobody supposes that you were his first inducement . he had seen you indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without knowing it to be you . so says my historian at least . is this true did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west to use her own words without knowing it to be you he certainly did . so far it is very true . at lyme . i happened to be at lyme . well continued mrs smith triumphantly grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted . he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there . but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain . if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me . my account states that your sisters friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walters acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger . here mrs smith paused a moment but anne had not a word to say and she continued this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail . now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliots opinions as to the value of a baronetcy . upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man . having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to . i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling . he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william . you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material . this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could . he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced . mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and readmitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay . he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject . you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do . yes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine . there is always something offensive in the details of cunning . the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me . i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied . i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared . i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not . lessening i understand replied mrs smith . he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence . but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence . mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay . a scheme worthy of mrs walliss understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it . why to be sure maam said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else . and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walters making a second match . she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs walliss recommendation i am very glad to know all this said anne after a little thoughtfulness . it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do . my line of conduct will be more direct . mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness . but mr elliot was not done with . mrs smith had been carried away from her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interest of her own family concerns how much had been originally implied against him but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints and she listened to a recital which if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her very deficient both in justice and compassion . she learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by mr elliots marriage they had been as before always together and mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune . mrs smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender of throwing any on her husband but anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance . from his wifes account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong understanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him led by him and probably despised by him . mr elliot raised by his marriage to great affluence and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself for with all his selfindulgence he had become a prudent man and beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friends probable finances but on the contrary had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths accordingly had been ruined . the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it . they had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends and to prove that mr elliots had better not be tried but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known . with a confidence in mr elliots regard more creditable to his feelings than his judgement mr smith had appointed him the executor of his will but mr elliot would not act and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to without corresponding indignation . anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to urgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and under a cold civility the same hardhearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her . it was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity and anne felt at some moments that no flagrant open crime could have been worse . she had a great deal to listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae of distress upon distress which in former conversations had been merely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence . anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friends usual state of mind . there was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation . she had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the west indies which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures and this property though not large would be enough to make her comparatively rich . but there was nobody to stir in it . mr elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness and from employing others by her want of money . she had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law . this was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means . to feel that she ought to be in better circumstances that a little trouble in the right place might do it and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims was hard to bear . it was on this point that she had hoped to engage annes good offices with mr elliot . she had previously in the anticipation of their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature since he did not even know her to be in bath it immediately occurred that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest annes feelings as far as the observances due to mr elliots character would allow when annes refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything and while it took from her the newformed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way . after listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not but express some surprise at mrs smiths having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation . she had seemed to recommend and praise him my dear was mrs smiths reply there was nothing else to be done . i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him than if he had been your husband . my heart bled for you as i talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless . he was very unkind to his first wife . they were wretched together . but she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her . i was willing to hope that you must fare better . anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed . it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady russell and under such a supposition which would have been most miserable when time had disclosed all too late it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference which carried them through the greater part of the morning was that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to mrs smith in which his conduct was involved . chapter 22 anne went home to think over all that she had heard . in one point her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot . there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him . he stood as opposed to captain wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness and the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief he might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed . pity for him was all over . but this was the only point of relief . in every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward she saw more to distrust and to apprehend . she was concerned for the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing how to avert any one of them . she was most thankful for her own knowledge of him . she had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like mrs smith but here was a reward indeed springing from it mrs smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done . could the knowledge have been extended through her family but this was a vain idea . she must talk to lady russell tell her consult with her and having done her best wait the event with as much composure as possible and after all her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself . she found on reaching home that she had as she intended escaped seeing mr elliot that he had called and paid them a long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself and felt safe when she heard that he was coming again in the evening . i had not the smallest intention of asking him said elizabeth with affected carelessness but he gave so many hints so mrs clay says at least . indeed i do say it . i never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation . poor man i was really in pain for him for your hardhearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty . oh cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentlemans hints . however when i found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and sir walter together . they appear to so much advantage in company with each other . each behaving so pleasantly . mr elliot looking up with so much respect . quite delightful cried mrs clay not daring however to turn her eyes towards anne . exactly like father and son dear miss elliot may i not say father and son oh i lay no embargo on any bodys words . if you will have such ideas but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men . my dear miss elliot exclaimed mrs clay lifting her hands and eyes and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence . well my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him . i did invite him you know . i sent him away with smiles . when i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park for the whole day tomorrow i had compassion on him . anne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew such pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object . it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate the sight of mr elliot and yet she could assume a most obliging placid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have done otherwise . to anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her . she had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere but now she saw insincerity in everything . his attentive deference to her father contrasted with his former language was odious and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness or the sound of his artificial good sentiments . she meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side . it was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retrace as quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along . she was accordingly more guarded and more cool than she had been the night before . he wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was broken he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousins vanity he found at least that it was not to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the toocommanding claims of the others . he little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable . she had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath the next morning going early and that he would be gone the greater part of two days . he was invited again to camden place the very evening of his return but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain . it was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort . it was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and elizabeth to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them mrs clays selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his and anne would have compounded for the marriage at once with all its evils to be clear of mr elliots subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it . on friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell and accomplish the necessary communication and she would have gone directly after breakfast but that mrs clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion . she saw mrs clay fairly off therefore before she began to talk of spending the morning in rivers street . very well said elizabeth i have nothing to send but my love . oh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me and pretend i have read it through . i really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out . lady russell quite bores one with her new publications . you need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other night . i used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her at the concert . something so formal and arrange in her air and she sits so upright my best love of course . and mine added sir walter . kindest regards . and you may say that i mean to call upon her soon . make a civil message but i shall only leave my card . morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life who make themselves up so little . if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen but last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately . while her father spoke there was a knock at the door . who could it be anne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of mr elliot would have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles off . after the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heard and mr and mrs charles musgrove were ushered into the room . surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance but anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soon as it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived with an views of accommodation in that house sir walter and elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very well . they were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove and were at the white hart . so much was pretty soon understood but till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into the other drawingroom and regaling themselves with her admiration anne could not draw upon charless brain for a regular history of their coming or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of . she then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove henrietta and captain harville beside their two selves . he gave her a very plain intelligible account of the whole a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding . the scheme had received its first impulse by captain harvilles wanting to come to bath on business . he had begun to talk of it a week ago and by way of doing something as shooting was over charles had proposed coming with him and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much as an advantage to her husband but mary could not bear to be left and had made herself so unhappy about it that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense or at an end . but then it had been taken up by his father and mother . his mother had some old friends in bath whom she wanted to see it was thought a good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy weddingclothes for herself and her sister and in short it ended in being his mothers party that everything might be comfortable and easy to captain harville and he and mary were included in it by way of general convenience . they had arrived late the night before . mrs harville her children and captain benwick remained with mr musgrove and louisa at uppercross . annes only surprise was that affairs should be in forwardness enough for henriettas weddingclothes to be talked of . she had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand but she learned from charles that very recently since marys last letter to herself charles hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years and that on the strength of his present income with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question the two families had consented to the young peoples wishes and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months quite as soon as louisas . and a very good living it was charles added only fiveandtwenty miles from uppercross and in a very fine country fine part of dorsetshire . in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom surrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous than the other and to two of the three at least charles hayter might get a special recommendation . not that he will value it as he ought he observed charles is too cool about sporting . thats the worst of him . i am extremely glad indeed cried anne particularly glad that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort . i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both . oh yes . my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer but he has no other fault to find . money you know coming down with moneytwo daughters at onceit cannot be a very agreeable operation and it streightens him as to many things . however i do not mean to say they have not a right to it . it is very fit they should have daughters shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind liberal father to me . mary does not above half like henriettas match . she never did you know . but she does not do him justice nor think enough about winthrop . i cannot make her attend to the value of the property . it is a very fair match as times go and i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now . such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove exclaimed anne should be happy in their childrens marriages . they do everything to confer happiness i am sure . what a blessing to young people to be in such hands your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery both in young and old . i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered now he answered rather hesitatingly yes i believe i do very much recovered but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing or dancing it is quite different . if one happens only to shut the door a little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dabchick in the water and benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her all day long . anne could not help laughing . that cannot be much to your taste i know said she but i do believe him to be an excellent young man . to be sure he is . nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself . i have a great value for benwick and when one can but get him to talk he has plenty to say . his reading has done him no harm for he has fought as well as read . he is a brave fellow . i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before . we had a famous setto at rathunting all the morning in my fathers great barns and he played his part so well that i have liked him the better ever since . here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charless following the others to admire mirrors and china but anne had heard enough to understand the present state of uppercross and rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoiced her sigh had none of the illwill of envy in it . she would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want to lessen theirs . the visit passed off altogether in high good humour . mary was in excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change and so well satisfied with the journey in her motherinlaws carriage with four horses and with her own complete independence of camden place that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house as they were detailed to her . she had no demands on her father or sister and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawingrooms . elizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal . she felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them but she could not bear to have the difference of style the reduction of servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch . it was a struggle between propriety and vanity but vanity got the better and then elizabeth was happy again . these were her internal persuasions old fashioned notions country hospitality we do not profess to give dinners few people in bath do lady alicia never does did not even ask her own sisters family though they were here a month and i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove put her quite out of her way . i am sure she would rather not come she cannot feel easy with us . i will ask them all for an evening that will be much better that will be a novelty and a treat . they have not seen two such drawing rooms before . they will be delighted to come tomorrow evening . it shall be a regular party small but most elegant . and this satisfied elizabeth and when the invitation was given to the two present and promised for the absent mary was as completely satisfied . she was particularly asked to meet mr elliot and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret who were fortunately already engaged to come and she could not have received a more gratifying attention . miss elliot was to have the honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning and anne walked off with charles and mary to go and see her and henrietta directly . her plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present . they all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes but anne convinced herself that a days delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence and hastened forward to the white hart to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn with an eagerness of goodwill which many associations contributed to form . they found mrs musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves and anne had the kindest welcome from each . henrietta was exactly in that state of recentlyimproved views of freshformed happiness which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all and mrs musgroves real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress . it was a heartiness and a warmth and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more from the sad want of such blessings at home . she was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible invited for every day and all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in return she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance and on charless leaving them together was listening to mrs musgroves history of louisa and to henriettas of herself giving opinions on business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every help which mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts from finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to trying to convince her that she was not illused by anybody which mary well amused as she generally was in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the pump room could not but have her moments of imagining . a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected . a large party in an hotel ensured a quickchanging unsettled scene . one five minutes brought a note the next a parcel and anne had not been there half an hour when their diningroom spacious as it was seemed more than half filled a party of steady old friends were seated around mrs musgrove and charles came back with captains harville and wentworth . the appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment . it was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again . their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings she had derived from it a delightful conviction but she feared from his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had hastened him away from the concert room still governed . he did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation . she tried to be calm and leave things to take their course and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence surely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts must understand each other ere long . we are not boy and girl to be captiously irritable misled by every moments inadvertence and wantonly playing with our own happiness . and yet a few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company with each other under their present circumstances could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind . anne cried mary still at her window there is mrs clay i am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her . i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now . they seemed deep in talk . who is it come and tell me . good heavens i recollect . it is mr elliot himself . no cried anne quickly it cannot be mr elliot i assure you . he was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back till tomorrow . as she spoke she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret that she had said so much simple as it was . mary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin began talking very warmly about the family features and protesting still more positively that it was mr elliot calling again upon anne to come and look for herself but anne did not mean to stir and tried to be cool and unconcerned . her distress returned however on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors as if they believed themselves quite in the secret . it was evident that the report concerning her had spread and a short pause succeeded which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther . do come anne cried mary come and look yourself . you will be too late if you do not make haste . they are parting they are shaking hands . he is turning away . not know mr elliot indeed you seem to have forgot all about lyme . to pacify mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment anne did move quietly to the window . she was just in time to ascertain that it really was mr elliot which she had never believed before he disappeared on one side as mrs clay walked quickly off on the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest she calmly said yes it is mr elliot certainly . he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all or i may be mistaken i might not attend and walked back to her chair recomposed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well . the visitors took their leave and charles having civilly seen them off and then made a face at them and abused them for coming began with well mother i have done something for you that you will like . i have been to the theatre and secured a box for tomorrow night . ant i a good boy i know you love a play and there is room for us all . it holds nine . i have engaged captain wentworth . anne will not be sorry to join us i am sure . we all like a play . have not i done well mother mrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play if henrietta and all the others liked it when mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming good heavens charles how can you think of such a thing take a box for tomorrow night have you forgot that we are engaged to camden place tomorrow night and that we were most particularly asked to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them how can you be so forgetful phoo phoo replied charles whats an evening party never worth remembering . your father might have asked us to dinner i think if he had wanted to see us . you may do as you like but i shall go to the play . oh charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do when you promised to go . no i did not promise . i only smirked and bowed and said the word happy . there was no promise . but you must go charles . it would be unpardonable to fail . we were asked on purpose to be introduced . there was always such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves . nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately . we are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with every attention is due to mr elliot . consider my fathers heir the future representative of the family . dont talk to me about heirs and representatives cried charles . i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun . if i would not go for the sake of your father i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir . what is mr elliot to me the careless expression was life to anne who saw that captain wentworth was all attention looking and listening with his whole soul and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from charles to herself . charles and mary still talked on in the same style he half serious and half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she invariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting to make it known that however determined to go to camden place herself she should not think herself very well used if they went to the play without her . mrs musgrove interposed . we had better put it off . charles you had much better go back and change the box for tuesday . it would be a pity to be divided and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her fathers and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play if miss anne could not be with us . anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying if it depended only on my inclination maam the party at home excepting on marys account would not be the smallest impediment . i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy to change it for a play and with you . but it had better not be attempted perhaps . she had spoken it but she trembled when it was done conscious that her words were listened to and daring not even to try to observe their effect . it was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife by persisting that he would go to the play tomorrow if nobody else would . captain wentworth left his seat and walked to the fireplace probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards and taking a station with less barefaced design by anne . you have not been long enough in bath said he to enjoy the evening parties of the place . oh no . the usual character of them has nothing for me . i am no cardplayer . you were not formerly i know . you did not use to like cards but time makes many changes . i am not yet so much changed cried anne and stopped fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction . after waiting a few moments he said and as if it were the result of immediate feeling it is a period indeed eight years and a half is a period . whether he would have proceeded farther was left to annes imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered she was startled to other subjects by henrietta eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out and calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody else should come in . they were obliged to move . anne talked of being perfectly ready and tried to look it but she felt that could henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair in preparing to quit the room she would have found in all her own sensations for her cousin in the very security of his affection wherewith to pity her . their preparations however were stopped short . alarming sounds were heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown open for sir walter and miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give a general chill . anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same . the comfort the freedom the gaiety of the room was over hushed into cold composure determined silence or insipid talk to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister . how mortifying to feel that it was so her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular . captain wentworth was acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than before . she even addressed him once and looked at him more than once . elizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure . the sequel explained it . after the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves . tomorrow evening to meet a few friends no formal party . it was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she had provided herself the miss elliot at home were laid on the table with a courteous comprehensive smile to all and one smile and one card more decidedly for captain wentworth . the truth was that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his . the past was nothing . the present was that captain wentworth would move about well in her drawingroom . the card was pointedly given and sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared . the interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out but not to anne . she could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which it had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather than gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance . she knew him she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonement for all the insolence of the past . her spirits sank . he held the card in his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it . only think of elizabeths including everybody whispered mary very audibly . i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted you see he cannot put the card out of his hand . anne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt and turned away that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her . the party separated . the gentlemen had their own pursuits the ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more while anne belonged to them . she was earnestly begged to return and dine and give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more and fit only for home where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose . promising to be with them the whole of the following morning therefore she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrows party the frequent enumeration of the persons invited and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in bath while harassing herself with the neverending question of whether captain wentworth would come or not they were reckoning him as certain but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together . she generally thought he would come because she generally thought he ought but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings . she only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation to let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of bath for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself she determined to mention it and it seemed to her there was guilt in mrs clays face as she listened . it was transient cleared away in an instant but anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having by some complication of mutual trick or some overbearing authority of his been obliged to attend perhaps for half an hour to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on sir walter . she exclaimed however with a very tolerable imitation of nature  oh dear very true . only think miss elliot to my great surprise i met with mr elliot in bath street . i was never more astonished . he turned back and walked with me to the pump yard . he had been prevented setting off for thornberry but i really forget by what for i was in a hurry and could not much attend and i can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return . he wanted to know how early he might be admitted tomorrow . he was full of tomorrow and it is very evident that i have been full of it too ever since i entered the house and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head . chapter 23 one day only had passed since annes conversation with mrs smith but a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched by mr elliots conduct except by its effects in one quarter that it became a matter of course the next morning still to defer her explanatory visit in rivers street . she had promised to be with the musgroves from breakfast to dinner . her faith was plighted and mr elliots character like the sultaness scheherazades head must live another day . she could not keep her appointment punctually however the weather was unfavourable and she had grieved over the rain on her friends account and felt it very much on her own before she was able to attempt the walk . when she reached the white hart and made her way to the proper apartment she found herself neither arriving quite in time nor the first to arrive . the party before her were mrs musgrove talking to mrs croft and captain harville to captain wentworth and she immediately heard that mary and henrietta too impatient to wait had gone out the moment it had cleared but would be back again soon and that the strictest injunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there till they returned . she had only to submit sit down be outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed . there was no delay no waste of time . she was deep in the happiness of such misery or the misery of such happiness instantly . two minutes after her entering the room captain wentworth said we will write the letter we were talking of harville now if you will give me materials . materials were at hand on a separate table he went to it and nearly turning his back to them all was engrossed by writing . mrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest daughters engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper . anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yet as captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such as how mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again to talk it over what my brother hayter had said one day and what mr musgrove had proposed the next and what had occurred to my sister hayter and what the young people had wished and what i said at first i never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well and a great deal in the same style of openhearted communication minutiae which even with every advantage of taste and delicacy which good mrs musgrove could not give could be properly interesting only to the principals . mrs croft was attending with great goodhumour and whenever she spoke at all it was very sensibly . anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much selfoccupied to hear . and so maam all these thing considered said mrs musgrove in her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer for charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was pretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once and make the best of it as many others have done before them . at any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement . that is precisely what i was going to observe cried mrs croft . i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be involved in a long engagement . i always think that no mutual oh dear mrs croft cried mrs musgrove unable to let her finish her speech there is nothing i so abominate for young people as a long engagement . it is what i always protested against for my children . it is all very well i used to say for young people to be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months or even in twelve but a long engagement yes dear maam said mrs croft or an uncertain engagement an engagement which may be long . to begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying i hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what i think all parents should prevent as far as they can . anne found an unexpected interest here . she felt its application to herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table captain wentworths pen ceased to move his head was raised pausing listening and he turned round the next instant to give a look one quick conscious look at her . the two ladies continued to talk to reurge the same admitted truths and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation but anne heard nothing distinctly it was only a buzz of words in her ear her mind was in confusion . captain harville who had in truth been hearing none of it now left his seat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch him though it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood . he looked at her with a smile and a little motion of the head which expressed come to me i have something to say and the unaffected easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was strongly enforced the invitation . she roused herself and went to him . the window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting and though nearer to captain wentworths table not very near . as she joined him captain harvilles countenance reassumed the serious thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character . look here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displaying a small miniature painting do you know who that is certainly captain benwick . yes and you may guess who it is for . but in a deep tone it was not done for her . miss elliot do you remember our walking together at lyme and grieving for him i little thought then but no matter . this was drawn at the cape . he met with a clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another it was a commission to me but who else was there to employ i hope i can allow for him . i am not sorry indeed to make it over to another . he undertakes it looking towards captain wentworth he is writing about it now . and with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding poor fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon no replied anne in a low feeling voice . that i can easily believe . it was not in her nature . she doted on him . it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved . captain harville smiled as much as to say do you claim that for your sex and she answered the question smiling also yes . we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us . it is perhaps our fate rather than our merit . we cannot help ourselves . we live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us . you are forced on exertion . you have always a profession pursuits business of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions . granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply to benwick . he has not been forced upon any exertion . the peace turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us in our little family circle ever since . true said anne very true i did not recollect but what shall we say now captain harville if the change be not from outward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature mans nature which has done the business for captain benwick . no no it is not mans nature . i will not allow it to be more mans nature than womans to be inconstant and forget those they do love or have loved . i believe the reverse . i believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are the strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage and riding out the heaviest weather . your feelings may be the strongest replied anne but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender . man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments . nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise . you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with . you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship . your home country friends all quitted . neither time nor health nor life to be called your own . it would be hard indeed with a faltering voice if womans feelings were to be added to all this . we shall never agree upon this question captain harville was beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention to captain wentworths hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room . it was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think he could have caught . have you finished your letter said captain harville . not quite a few lines more . i shall have done in five minutes . there is no hurry on my side . i am only ready whenever you are . i am in very good anchorage here smiling at anne well supplied and want for nothing . no hurry for a signal at all . well miss elliot lowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agree i suppose upon this point . no man and woman would probably . but let me observe that all histories are against youall stories prose and verse . if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon womans inconstancy . songs and proverbs all talk of womans fickleness . but perhaps you will say these were all written by men . perhaps i shall . yes yes if you please no reference to examples in books . men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story . education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands . i will not allow books to prove anything . but how shall we prove anything we never shall . we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point . it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof . we each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances perhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence or in some respect saying what should not be said . ah cried captain harville in a tone of strong feeling if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children and watches the boat that he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight and then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again and then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again when coming back after a twelvemonths absence perhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself and saying they cannot be here till such a day but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last as if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do and glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence i speak you know only of such men as have hearts pressing his own with emotion . oh cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you and by those who resemble you . god forbid that i should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellowcreatures i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman . no i believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives . i believe you equal to every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance so long asif i may be allowed the expressionso long as you have an object . i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you . all the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one you need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence or when hope is gone . she could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart was too full her breath too much oppressed . you are a good soul cried captain harville putting his hand on her arm quite affectionately . there is no quarrelling with you . and when i think of benwick my tongue is tied . their attention was called towards the others . mrs croft was taking leave . here frederick you and i part company i believe said she . i am going home and you have an engagement with your friend . tonight we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party turning to anne . we had your sisters card yesterday and i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see it and you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves captain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste and either could not or would not answer fully . yes said he very true here we separate but harville and i shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready i am in half a minute . i know you will not be sorry to be off . i shall be at your service in half a minute . mrs croft left them and captain wentworth having sealed his letter with great rapidity was indeed ready and had even a hurried agitated air which shewed impatience to be gone . anne knew not how to understand it . she had the kindest good morning god bless you from captain harville but from him not a word nor a look he had passed out of the room without a look she had only time however to move closer to the table where he had been writing when footsteps were heard returning the door opened it was himself . he begged their pardon but he had forgotten his gloves and instantly crossing the room to the writing table he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper placed it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time and hastily collecting his gloves was again out of the room almost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it the work of an instant the revolution which one instant had made in anne was almost beyond expression . the letter with a direction hardly legible to miss a .  e .  was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily . while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick he had been also addressing her on the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her . anything was possible anything might be defied rather than suspense . mrs musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table to their protection she must trust and sinking into the chair which he had occupied succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written her eyes devoured the following words i can listen no longer in silence . i must speak to you by such means as are within my reach . you pierce my soul . i am half agony half hope . tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings are gone for ever . i offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago . dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman that his love has an earlier death . i have loved none but you . unjust i may have been weak and resentful i have been but never inconstant . you alone have brought me to bath . for you alone i think and plan . have you not seen this can you fail to have understood my wishes i had not waited even these ten days could i have read your feelings as i think you must have penetrated mine . i can hardly write . i am every instant hearing something which overpowers me . you sink your voice but i can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others . too good too excellent creature you do us justice indeed . you do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men . believe it to be most fervent most undeviating in f .  w .  i must go uncertain of my fate but i shall return hither or follow your party as soon as possible . a word a look will be enough to decide whether i enter your fathers house this evening or never . such a letter was not to be soon recovered from . half and hours solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted with all the restraints of her situation could do nothing towards tranquillity . every moment rather brought fresh agitation . it was overpowering happiness . and before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation charles mary and henrietta all came in . the absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle but after a while she could do no more . she began not to understand a word they said and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself . they could then see that she looked very ill were shocked and concerned and would not stir without her for the world . this was dreadful . would they only have gone away and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting and in desperation she said she would go home . by all means my dear cried mrs musgrove go home directly and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening . i wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself . charles ring and order a chair . she must not walk . but the chair would never do . worse than all to lose the possibility of speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet solitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting him could not be borne . the chair was earnestly protested against and mrs musgrove who thought only of one sort of illness having assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall in the case that anne had not at any time lately slipped down and got a blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend on finding her better at night . anxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said i am afraid maam that it is not perfectly understood . pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening . i am afraid there had been some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both . oh my dear it is quite understood i give you my word . captain harville has no thought but of going . do you think so but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry . will you promise me to mention it when you see them again you will see them both this morning i dare say . do promise me . to be sure i will if you wish it . charles if you see captain harville anywhere remember to give miss annes message . but indeed my dear you need not be uneasy . captain harville holds himself quite engaged ill answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare say . anne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity . it could not be very lasting however . even if he did not come to camden place himself it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by captain harville . another momentary vexation occurred . charles in his real concern and good nature would go home with her there was no preventing him . this was almost cruel . but she could not be long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmiths to be of use to her and she set off with him with no feeling but gratitude apparent . they were on union street when a quicker step behind a something of familiar sound gave her two moments preparation for the sight of captain wentworth . he joined them but as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on said nothing only looked . anne could command herself enough to receive that look and not repulsively . the cheeks which had been pale now glowed and the movements which had hesitated were decided . he walked by her side . presently struck by a sudden thought charles said captain wentworth which way are you going only to gay street or farther up the town i hardly know replied captain wentworth surprised . are you going as high as belmont are you going near camden place because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place and give anne your arm to her fathers door . she is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help and i ought to be at that fellows in the market place . he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment that i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance . by his description a good deal like the second size doublebarrel of mine which you shot with one day round winthrop . there could not be an objection . there could be only the most proper alacrity a most obliging compliance for public view and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture . in half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again and the other two proceeding together and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow . there they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything but which had been followed by so many many years of division and estrangement . there they returned again into the past more exquisitely happy perhaps in their reunion than when it had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed in a knowledge of each others character truth and attachment more equal to act more justified in acting . and there as they slowly paced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them seeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepers flirting girls nor nurserymaids and children they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest . all the little variations of the last week were gone through and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end . she had not mistaken him . jealousy of mr elliot had been the retarding weight the doubt the torment . that had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in bath that had returned after a short suspension to ruin the concert and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done or omitted to say and do in the last fourandtwenty hours . it had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks or words or actions occasionally encouraged it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with captain harville and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper and poured out his feelings . of what he had then written nothing was to be retracted or qualified . he persisted in having loved none but her . she had never been supplanted . he never even believed himself to see her equal . thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge that he had been constant unconsciously nay unintentionally that he had meant to forget her and believed it to be done . he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only been angry and he had been unjust to her merits because he had been a sufferer from them . her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross had he learnt to do her justice and only at lyme had he begun to understand himself . at lyme he had received lessons of more than one sort . the passing admiration of mr elliot had at least roused him and the scenes on the cobb and at captain harvilles had fixed her superiority . in his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove the attempts of angry pride he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible that he had not cared could not care for louisa though till that day till the leisure for reflection which followed it he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which louisas could so ill bear a comparison or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own . there he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of selfwill between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind . there he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost and there begun to deplore the pride the folly the madness of resentment which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way . from that period his penance had become severe . he had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of louisas accident no sooner begun to feel himself alive again than he had begun to feel himself though alive not at liberty . i found said he that i was considered by harville an engaged man that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment . i was startled and shocked . to a degree i could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect that others might have felt the sameher own family nay perhaps herselfi was no longer at my own disposal . i was hers in honour if she wished it . i had been unguarded . i had not thought seriously on this subject before . i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other ill effects . i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences . he found too late in short that he had entangled himself and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for louisa at all he must regard himself as bound to her if her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed . it determined him to leave lyme and await her complete recovery elsewhere . he would gladly weaken by any fair means whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist and he went therefore to his brothers meaning after a while to return to kellynch and act as circumstances might require . i was six weeks with edward said he and saw him happy . i could have no other pleasure . i deserved none . he enquired after you very particularly asked even if you were personally altered little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter . anne smiled and let it pass . it was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach . it is something for a woman to be assured in her eightandtwentieth year that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to anne by comparing it with former words and feeling it to be the result not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment . he had remained in shropshire lamenting the blindness of his own pride and the blunders of his own calculations till at once released from louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with benwick . here said he ended the worst of my state for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself i could do something . but to be waiting so long in inaction and waiting only for evil had been dreadful . within the first five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was . was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive with some degree of hope you were single . it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement happened to be mine . i could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help often saying was this for me their first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said but the concert still more . that evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments . the moment of her stepping forward in the octagon room to speak to him the moment of mr elliots appearing and tearing her away and one or two subsequent moments marked by returning hope or increasing despondency were dwelt on with energy . to see you cried he in the midst of those who could not be my wellwishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent to consider what powerful supports would be his was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared how could i look on without agony was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done was it not all against me you should have distinguished replied anne . you should not have suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different . if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk . when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called in aid here . in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk would have been incurred and all duty violated . perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus he replied but i could not . i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired of your character . i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under year after year . i could think of you only as one who had yielded who had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me . i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery . i had no reason to believe her of less authority now . the force of habit was to be added . i should have thought said anne that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this . no no your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give . i left you in this belief and yet i was determined to see you again . my spirits rallied with the morning and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here . at last anne was at home again and happier than any one in that house could have conceived . all the surprise and suspense and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation she reentered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last . an interval of meditation serious and grateful was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such highwrought felicity and she went to her room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment . the evening came the drawingrooms were lighted up the company assembled . it was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who had never met before and those who met too often a commonplace business too numerous for intimacy too small for variety but anne had never found an evening shorter . glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her . mr elliot was there she avoided but she could pity him . the wallises she had amusement in understanding them . lady dalrymple and miss carteretthey would soon be innoxious cousins to her . she cared not for mrs clay and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister . with the musgroves there was the happy chat of perfect ease with captain harville the kindhearted intercourse of brother and sister with lady russell attempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short with admiral and mrs croft everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest which the same consciousness sought to conceal and with captain wentworth some moments of communications continually occurring and always the hope of more and always the knowledge of his being there . it was in one of these short meetings each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants that she said i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself and i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now . to me she was in the place of a parent . do not mistake me however . i am not saying that she did not err in her advice . it was perhaps one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance of tolerable similarity give such advice . but i mean that i was right in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up because i should have suffered in my conscience . i have now as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing to reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a womans portion . he looked at her looked at lady russell and looking again at her replied as if in cool deliberation not yet . but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time . i trust to being in charity with her soon . but i too have been thinking over the past and a question has suggested itself whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady my own self . tell me if when i returned to england in the year eight with a few thousand pounds and was posted into the laconia if i had then written to you would you have answered my letter would you in short have renewed the engagement then would i was all her answer but the accent was decisive enough . good god he cried you would it is not that i did not think of it or desire it as what could alone crown all my other success but i was proud too proud to ask again . i did not understand you . i shut my eyes and would not understand you or do you justice . this is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself . six years of separation and suffering might have been spared . it is a sort of pain too which is new to me . i have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that i enjoyed . i have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards . like other great men under reverses he added with a smile . i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune . i must learn to brook being happier than i deserve . chapter 24 who can be in doubt of what followed when any two young people take it into their heads to marry they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprudent or ever so little likely to be necessary to each others ultimate comfort . this may be bad morality to conclude with but i believe it to be truth and if such parties succeed how should a captain wentworth and an anne elliot with the advantage of maturity of mind consciousness of right and one independent fortune between them fail of bearing down every opposition they might in fact have borne down a great deal more than they met with for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth . sir walter made no objection and elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned . captain wentworth with fiveandtwenty thousand pounds and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him was no longer nobody . he was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish spendthrift baronet who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which providence had placed him and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter . sir walter indeed though he had no affection for anne and no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasion was very far from thinking it a bad match for her . on the contrary when he saw more of captain wentworth saw him repeatedly by daylight and eyed him well he was very much struck by his personal claims and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank and all this assisted by his wellsounding name enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen with a very good grace for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour . the only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was lady russell . anne knew that lady russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with and do justice to captain wentworth . this however was what lady russell had now to do . she must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each that because captain wentworths manners had not suited her own ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity and that because mr elliots manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness their general politeness and suavity she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and wellregulated mind . there was nothing less for lady russell to do than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes . there is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discernment of character a natural penetration in short which no experience in others can equal and lady russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend . but she was a very good woman and if her second object was to be sensible and welljudging her first was to see anne happy . she loved anne better than she loved her own abilities and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child . of all the family mary was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance . it was creditable to have a sister married and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion by keeping anne with her in the autumn and as her own sister must be better than her husbands sisters it was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than either captain benwick or charles hayter . she had something to suffer perhaps when they came into contact again in seeing anne restored to the rights of seniority and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette but she had a future to look forward to of powerful consolation . anne had no uppercross hall before her no landed estate no headship of a family and if they could but keep captain wentworth from being made a baronet she would not change situations with anne . it would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation for a change is not very probable there . she had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him . the news of his cousins annes engagement burst on mr elliot most unexpectedly . it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness his best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness which a soninlaws rights would have given . but though discomfited and disappointed he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment . he soon quitted bath and on mrs clays quitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as established under his protection in london it was evident how double a game he had been playing and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman at least . mrs clays affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed for the young mans sake the possibility of scheming longer for sir walter . she has abilities however as well as affections and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning or hers may finally carry the day whether after preventing her from being the wife of sir walter he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of sir william . it cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of their deception in her . they had their great cousins to be sure to resort to for comfort but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others without being flattered and followed in turn is but a state of half enjoyment . anne satisfied at a very early period of lady russells meaning to love captain wentworth as she ought had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value . there she felt her own inferiority very keenly . the disproportion in their fortune was nothing it did not give her a moments regret but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly nothing of respectability of harmony of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity . she had but two friends in the world to add to his list lady russell and mrs smith . to those however he was very well disposed to attach himself . lady russell in spite of all her former transgressions he could now value from his heart . while he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour and as for mrs smith she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently . her recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselves and their marriage instead of depriving her of one friend secured her two . she was their earliest visitor in their settled life and captain wentworth by putting her in the way of recovering her husbands property in the west indies by writing for her acting for her and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend fully requited the services which she had rendered or ever meant to render to his wife . mrs smiths enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income with some improvement of health and the acquisition of such friends to be often with for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her and while these prime supplies of good remained she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity . she might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy and yet be happy . her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits as her friend annes was in the warmth of her heart . anne was tenderness itself and she had the full worth of it in captain wentworths affection . his profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine . she gloried in being a sailors wife but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is if possible more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance . finis'"
